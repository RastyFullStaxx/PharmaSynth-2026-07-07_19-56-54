## Tools/PharmaSynth

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Add Placement Anchors (drag to fine-tune)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneAnchors.cs`</sub>

Creates the draggable placement anchors the verbs read (user 2026-07-14: "can I drag these to the specific parts?"). After running this, each match/burner gets a "FlameAnchor" child and each scoopula/spatula a "ScoopAnchor" child, dropped at a best-guess spot. SELECT it in the Hierarchy (orange gizmo in the Scene view), drag it onto the exact part — match head, burner mouth, scoop bowl — then run Lock My Layout to bake it. Idempotent: never moves an anchor you've already positioned.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Adopt Manual Layout (W5.12)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ManualLayoutAdopter.cs`</sub>

W5.12: the user hand-placed the whole workspace (kits, duplicates, reagent shelf, spawn point) — this adopts that layout as canonical in ONE run: 1. renames editor duplicates ("Beaker_100mL (1)") to clean unique names + display names, and gives them the full interaction wiring; 2. re-points the teleport target (FrontDoorSpawn) at the rig's current pose — the user moved the avatar to the new spawn spot; 3. re-homes every DropRespawn to its current transform; 4. creates + registers the missing Dis

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Align Experiment Stages to Table`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/AlignExperimentStages.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): experiments spawn their stations/vessels/labels/ waypoints as children of DynamicStage (and Methane uses MethaneStage), both authored at the ORIGINAL center-table spot. When the user moved the whole workspace table into the room, the stages stayed put — so experiment content (incl. the coloured test watch-glasses the user saw as "pads", the stale name tags, and the waypoint) appeared where the table USED to be. This shifts both stages by the table's horizontal delta so a

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Apply W5.8 Verb Data`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/W58VerbDataApplier.cs`</sub>

One-shot, idempotent data pass for the W5.8 verb overhaul: re-points the layouts whose tasks are now TOOL verbs (weigh/stir/grind) and wires the scene-side pieces (Methane's hand-built mortar, the matches-box striker). • Acetone: `weigh-acetates` zone-touch → Weigh (scoopula on the pan). • Benzamide: `stand` ("Stir & stand") zone-touch → Stir (glass rod). • Scene: Methane's Eq_Motar/Eq_Pestle get a GrindController completing `prepare-mixture` (dual-path with the legacy zone-touch), and the match

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Apply W5.9 Manuscript Data`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/W59ManuscriptDataApplier.cs`</sub>

sulfuric acid; no alcohol anywhere) → propyl alcohol staged + bound, rule re-pointed to it (manuscript/test intent: ester with propyl). M2  Chloroform was missing the manuscript's oxidation confirmatory test (K-dichromate + conc H2SO4, procedure L3419-21 + results sheet) → new task + reagent + reaction rule. M3  Wine Making fermented GRAPE juice against the manuscript's explicit grape exclusion (L3830-31) → Chem_GrapeJuice renamed "Mixed Fruit Juice" (GUID refs untouched; string lookups updated)

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Audit Chemical Hazard Flags`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ChemHazardFlagAudit.cs`</sub>

Stamps the HazardousMix flags (isOxidizer / isConcentratedAcid) onto every ChemicalData asset from the pure HazardFlags name rules, and ensures the Chem_RuinedMixture SO (the dark sludge an overheated batch turns into) exists and is registered in the SceneAssetLibrary. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Audit Chemical States`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ChemicalStateAudit.cs`</sub>

W5.12 reagent-nature audit (user: "double check the reagents if all by nature are really liquid and needed to be scooped"). Dumps every ChemicalData's state/flags to Temp/chemical-state-audit.md and flags chemicals that are solids in their common lab form but are marked Liquid (manuscript solutions like "10% NaOH" are correctly liquid — only pure solids that get weighed/scooped are suspects).

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Audit Reachability`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReachabilityAudit.cs`</sub>

Asks the one question the run simulator structurally cannot: a step can be mechanically perfect while the bottle it needs sits inside a closed cabinet or above head height. `SimulatedRun` reaches every object by reference, so it will never notice — only a headset would, which is exactly the cost this is here to avoid. Its input is already built and already verified: `TutorialTargets.Build()` resolves taskId → the objects each step is about, for all 9 modules. So the audit asks, of every object a

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Audit Tutorial Targets`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TutorialModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds every module's stage IN EDIT MODE and reports which steps resolve to no scene object — i.e. where Tutorial Mode would tell the player to act with nothing to point at. NOT a self-test pin, deliberately: this has to Build() each stage, which mutates the open scene, and the suite must stay side-effect-free. Run it by hand after changing a module's tasks, layout, or verb wiring. Like Reveal Stage, it leaves the LAST module's stage standing — rebuild or reopen the scene afterwards.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Autopilot Playtest (TUTORIAL Mode — checks the guidance)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlaytestAutopilot.cs`</sub>

⭐ Tutorial Mode had NEVER been played by the autopilot until W5.44b. The campaign sweep enters via "Laboratory", so `TutorialSession.Active` stays false and every guidance cue — glow, ghost, beacon, spotlight, verb demo, wrong-grab nudge, need line, ping, ground path — correctly does nothing. The whole mode was untested in motion, and the ground path reported "dist 0.0, no route" in all nine modules for exactly that reason.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Autopilot Playtest (VISUAL — honest verbs + vessel close-ups)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlaytestAutopilot.cs`</sub>

⭐ VISUAL (W5.45): the campaign loop again, but every step is performed HONESTLY through SimulatedRun's verbs (real pours and scoop dips, the water bath, the ice bucket, the glass rod, a real litmus strip...) and then PHOTOGRAPHED — a close-up of the vessel the step happened in, plus the numbers behind the picture, judged against the fired reaction's manuscript observation. The other two modes complete steps by calling CompleteTask, so nothing ever happens in a vessel and their screenshots show a

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Autopilot Playtest (plays the game in Play mode)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlaytestAutopilot.cs`</sub>

⭐ Why this exists on top of Simulate Everything: that battery runs in EDIT mode, where Update never ticks, coroutines never run, physics never steps, XRI never selects anything and no audio plays. Every bug that only exists in MOTION is invisible to it — which is precisely where the §13 playtest findings live (items vanishing, dialogue stomping mid-typing, the holo panel not scrolling, quiz buttons not clickable), and where W5.34's "711 errors/second from SpawnVFX" lived. ⭐ No headset needed: PC

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Brighten Lab Lighting`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabLightingBuilder.cs`</sub>

Brightens the lab so it reads as a well-lit laboratory (user 2026-07-10: "a lab must be well-lit, currently our lab-room is dim"). Quest-friendly recipe — NO extra shadow-casting lights: 1. The 16 ceiling `Light (n)` fixture meshes get a white EMISSIVE panel material (they were unlit gray boxes). 2. Flat ambient raised from the dark skybox gray (0.21) to a bright neutral. 3. A small grid of shadowless point lights (`LabLights` group, re-runnable) fills the room — 6 lights, wide range, warm-white

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Atmosphere VFX`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/AtmosphereBuilder.cs`</sub>

Places the ambient atmosphere emitters (user 2026-07-10): cool vapour sinking from the AC unit + a faint haze layer near the floor and ceiling. Low-density on purpose (Quest overdraw). Door cold-air is code-hooked in DoorOpener, not here. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Atmosphere VFX (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Cube Room FX`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TutorialModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Adds atmosphere to the cube spawn room: breathing neon trim, drifting light levels with the occasional arc stutter, floor haze and slow rising motes. Deliberately built from PARTICLES + emissive pulsing rather than post-processing: this is the first thing a Quest 3 player sees, a full-screen effect stack costs frame budget on a mobile GPU for the whole session, and the room only needs to look alive, not cinematic. Idempotent — re-running replaces its own objects.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Hand Visuals`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HandVisualsBuilder.cs`</sub>

v4 (user 2026-07-11): controllers are REPLACED by skinned hands — XR Hands sample meshes (Art/Hands/LeftHand.fbx + RightHand.fbx, real finger bones). Two skins: bare (HandSkin.mat) / nitrile blue (HandNitrile.mat) driven by the PPE gloves state; two poses: free / grab (finger curl while selecting) driven by HandPoseController. Retires the old procedural mittens, HandVisualKeeper AND the FPGlove_* first-person glove clones (PPE visuals rebound to the mirror gloves only — first-person gloving is n

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Hover Info Panel`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HoverInfoBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the hover-inspector info card + wires the raycasting HoverInspector into SampleScene (user 2026-07-10). Point the right-hand ray (or gaze) at a reagent, a piece of apparatus or an NPC and a smoothly-animated card names it and explains what it is / how to use it. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Hover Info Panel (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Jimenez HUD Portrait`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/JimenezHudPortraitBuilder.cs`</sub>

Gives Dr. Jimenez a HUD presence equal to Pharmee's (user 2026-07-19: "let's make dr jimenez same as pharmee that appears in our HUD as well. so we'll need to create an icon image for dr. jimenez as well"). Two jobs, both idempotent: 1. RENDER his portrait from his own rigged model — a transparent-background headshot framed on the humanoid Head bone. No AI generation (so no credits, and no risk of a portrait that looks like a different person): the icon IS the character the player meets. → Art/U

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Jimenez HUD Portrait (re-render icon)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/JimenezHudPortraitBuilder.cs`</sub>

Gives Dr. Jimenez a HUD presence equal to Pharmee's (user 2026-07-19: "let's make dr jimenez same as pharmee that appears in our HUD as well. so we'll need to create an icon image for dr. jimenez as well"). Two jobs, both idempotent: 1. RENDER his portrait from his own rigged model — a transparent-background headshot framed on the humanoid Head bone. No AI generation (so no credits, and no risk of a portrait that looks like a different person): the icon IS the character the player meets. → Art/U

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Lab Alarm`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabAlarmBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the lab's hazard-alarm fixture (manuscript: "flashing lights, warning messages, alarm beeps"): a small red ceiling box + one red point light + LabAlarm, centred over the lab. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Lab Music Speaker`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MusicSpeakerBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the corner music speaker in the lab (user 2026-07-10): a floor-standing speaker cabinet in the empty back-right corner that plays the Background_Music/Lab playlist as a 3D positional source (louder as you approach) and fades in/out with the screen fade on menu<->lab transitions. Also disables the old 2D LabMusicPlayer bed and re-points the menu-room music to the user's supplied track. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Lab Music Speaker (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Lab NavMesh (ground path routing)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabNavMeshBuilder.cs`</sub>

Bakes the walkable surface Tutorial Mode's ground path routes on (W5.44). Without this there is no NavMesh in the project at all, and `GuidePath` silently draws nothing — the floor arrows would look "not implemented" rather than "not baked", which is exactly the sort of silence this codebase has been bitten by before. ⚠ **The bake goes STALE when furniture moves**, precisely like the lightmap bake — the benches ARE the obstacles it routes around. Re-run this in the same breath as `Build Lab Prob

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Lab Probes`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabProbeBuilder.cs`</sub>

blending AND box projection switched on - the features were paid for with nothing to feed them. Two consequences the player sees constantly: * Every glass material in the ChemLab pack sets _EnvironmentReflections = 1, so with no probe they all sampled the DEFAULT reflection - the built-in procedural outdoor sky - inside a sealed windowless room. That is why beakers and flasks read as pale plastic. * Every dynamic object (all grabbable glassware, held items, Pharmee, Dr. Jimenez) was lit by flat 

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Menu Cube Room`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MenuCubeRoomBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the futuristic CUBE SPAWN ROOM in the MainMenu scene (user 2026-07-10): a fully-enclosed, solid, dark room with cyan/teal emissive trim, a couple of soft lights and a glowing floor launch-pad under the menu panel. Sealed on all six sides so no skybox leaks. Re-runnable and idempotent — deletes the prior "MenuCubeRoom" and rebuilds it, and hides the old open "MenuRoom" dressing. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Menu Cube Room. Run with the MainMenu scene open.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build PPE Wearables`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PPEWearablesBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the per-piece wearable PPE (user 2026-07-10): 1. The locker's goggles + gloves become CLICKABLE (collider + XRSimpleInteractable + PPEDonOnSelect), the coat display forwards Coat, and the legacy don-everything paths are disabled (host donOnSelect off, coat display's old persistent calls cleared). 2. Worn visuals cloned from the locker models onto the mirror avatar's bones (coat→Spine01, goggles→Head, gloves→hand bones — PlayerAvatar layer, mirror-only) and first-person gloves onto the cont

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Player Avatar`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlayerAvatarBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the mirror-only first-person avatar (user 2026-07-10). Expects a rigged humanoid prefab (Tripo image→3D + Tripo Rigging v1, casual clothes, T-pose) in Art/Generated/Models with "player"/"avatar" in its name — or select it in the Project. Places it under the XR rig, puts it on the PlayerAvatar layer (culled by the main camera, shown by the mirror), and wires an Animation-Rigging IK setup: two-bone IK on each arm (hands→controllers) + a head rotation constraint (head→HMD), driven by PlayerA

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Quiz Back-Next Buttons`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/QuizNavButtonsBuilder.cs`</sub>

Add "< Back" / "Next >" buttons to the quiz tablet (user 2026-07-15: "so users can review their answers before submitting"). Clones the existing Submit button so styling matches, wires them to PostLabController.PreviousQuestion/NextQuestion, assigns the controller's prevButton/nextButton refs (which grey out at the ends), and makes sure the quiz canvas is XR-ray clickable. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Reagent Cabinets`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReagentCabinetBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the raw-reagent storage (user 2026-07-10: the manuscript's ~54 materials must exist in the lab): three open shelf units against the wall, stocked from RawReagentCatalog with nature-appropriate labware — reagent bottles, amber bottles for the light-sensitive, powder jars, dropper bottles, consumable boxes (litmus/matches/cotton/filter) and an ice bucket. Every bottle is grabbable, pourable, spill-graded and hover-explained. Chemicals already displayed on the legacy ReagentShelf are skipped

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Review Corner`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReviewCornerBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the post-experiment review corner (user 2026-07-11): a ReviewCornerSpawn marker in front of the PostLabTablet (biased toward Dr. Jimenez's spot) that the gatekeeper fade-teleports the player to for the quiz-review flow, plus the gatekeeper's postLab/examiner refs and the quiz's autoOpen=false (the gate now opens the quiz after Jimenez's briefing). Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Spawn VFX`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SpawnVfxBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the cyan "materialize" spawn burst (user 2026-07-10): a one-shot column of cyan particles that rises from the player's feet like smoke, played on every teleport / reset / spawn. Creates a shared soft-dot texture + additive material, then drops a configured `SpawnVFX` object (SpawnBurstFX + ParticleSystem) into the ACTIVE scene. Re-runnable. Run it once in MainMenu and once in SampleScene. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Spawn VFX.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Tutorial Menu Button`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TutorialModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Tutorial Mode scene wiring (2026-08-07). Mirrors DemoModeBuilder's shape so the two special modes are built the same way: • Build Tutorial Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a "Tutorial" button wired to MainMenuController.OnTutorialLaboratory. Unlike the Demo button this one is ALWAYS visible — practice mode is a shipped feature, not a config-gated demo affordance. Idempotent: re-running re-labels and re-wires the existing button in place.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Tutorial Scene Wiring`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TutorialModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires Tutorial Mode into the lab scene: • TutorialHighlighter on the runner's object, bound to the runner • WaypointGuide bound to the runner (it has been dead since the zone-free conversion killed the station registry it used to read) • the beacon's arrow + disc switched to a ZTest Always material so the marker reads THROUGH a closed cabinet door — the "see it through things" requirement, without touching any shared bench material. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Workspace Kits`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/WorkspaceKitsBuilder.cs`</sub>

apparatus that belong together… place them tightly but not overlapping… generous duplicates of high-use glass"). Kit composition follows the manuscript's Appendix C Equipment lists + the game's Methane heating rig: TOP row   — Heating Set A (full Bunsen rig), Heating Set B (compact Bunsen rig), Alcohol-Burner Set (spirit lamp + clay triangle + crucible: the crucible-work set — the manuscript names no burner, so Bunsen = sustained heat, alcohol lamp = crucible). LOWER row — 4 test-tube rack kits 

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Build Workspace Shelf`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/WorkspaceShelfBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the equipment-shelf platforms on the center-table overhead gantry. W5.10 built one row on the rail tops; W5.12 adds the SECOND, lower row the user hand-planked at y≈1.20 (four duplicated cabinet shelves — replaced here by clean full-width tiles + slim side posts so the lower row reads as built in, not floating). Idempotent + re-runnable. Geometry lives in the pure WorkspaceShelfMath; the apparatus kits go on via Build Workspace Kits.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Consolidate Procedure Panels`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PanelConsolidationBuilder.cs`</sub>

One procedures display (user 2026-07-10): the entrance LabTablet duplicated the wrist holo board, and the wrist mini-panel duplicated the holo header — three surfaces fighting over the same content, with the tablet's fixed rect overflowing into its reaction footer. This menu retires the LabTablet (deactivated, not deleted) and the MiniPanel, and upgrades the holo board to the single panel: status header (ex mini-panel) + focused checklist + the balanced-reaction footer (ex tablet). Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Damp Jimenez Arm Swing`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/JimenezArmDamper.cs`</sub>

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AND THE RE-WEIGHT DOES NOT. The obvious fix — move the coat's vertex weights off the arm bones — was built, measured and REVERTED. On this asset the coat and the sleeve are one continuous surface with no seam to cut along, so any weight change big enough to free the coat is big enough to rip it: against the untouched mesh, worst edge stretch went 4.2x → 14.9x and torn edges 32 → 174. Smoothing the transfer across a band removed the tearing but then barely moved the coat either 

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Demo/Build Demo HUD`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DemoModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Demo Mode scene wiring (user 2026-07-10). Three menus: • Build Demo Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a config-gated "Demo Mode" button wired to MainMenuController.OnDemoLaboratory. • Build Demo HUD — SampleScene: a Skip Step / Finish Experiment / Auto-Answer Quiz row under the HUD's top-right cluster, driven by DemoHudController. • Demo Enabled (persistent override) — toggles persistentDataPath/demo-config.json for in-editor testing (the shipped StreamingAssets def

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Demo/Build Demo Menu Button`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DemoModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Demo Mode scene wiring (user 2026-07-10). Three menus: • Build Demo Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a config-gated "Demo Mode" button wired to MainMenuController.OnDemoLaboratory. • Build Demo HUD — SampleScene: a Skip Step / Finish Experiment / Auto-Answer Quiz row under the HUD's top-right cluster, driven by DemoHudController. • Demo Enabled (persistent override) — toggles persistentDataPath/demo-config.json for in-editor testing (the shipped StreamingAssets def

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Demo/Demo Enabled (persistent override)`

Demo Mode scene wiring (user 2026-07-10). Three menus: • Build Demo Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a config-gated "Demo Mode" button wired to MainMenuController.OnDemoLaboratory. • Build Demo HUD — SampleScene: a Skip Step / Finish Experiment / Auto-Answer Quiz row under the HUD's top-right cluster, driven by DemoHudController. • Demo Enabled (persistent override) — toggles persistentDataPath/demo-config.json for in-editor testing (the shipped StreamingAssets def

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Dev Capture`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DevCapture.cs`</sub>

Dev-only capture bridge: renders a one-off camera to a PNG on disk so out-of-editor tooling can see the scene (the MCP scene-preview capture is broken on this machine). Pose/output come from Temp/dev-capture-request.json when present; defaults to the player spawn head pose.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix Cube Room Menu Layout`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TutorialModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Tutorial Mode scene wiring (2026-08-07). Mirrors DemoModeBuilder's shape so the two special modes are built the same way: • Build Tutorial Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a "Tutorial" button wired to MainMenuController.OnTutorialLaboratory. Unlike the Demo button this one is ALWAYS visible — practice mode is a shipped feature, not a config-gated demo affordance. Idempotent: re-running re-labels and re-wires the existing button in place.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix Holo Board Scroll`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PanelConsolidationBuilder.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user: "instruction step is one continuous row — wrap the texts and make the panel scrollable"): every holo text wraps, and the checklist body moves inside a masked, scrollable viewport with big ^ / v page buttons (poke/ray-friendly) driven by HoloScroller. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix Jimenez Coat Rig`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/JimenezCoatRig.cs`</sub>

lab coat moves with it, which it is not supposed to"). ⛔ There is nothing to unparent. He is a Tripo auto-rig: ONE SkinnedMeshRenderer over 41 bones, with the coat baked into the body mesh. The coat follows the arm because coat VERTICES carry weight on the arm bones — an auto-rigger assigns weight by proximity, so a coat panel hanging near the elbow picks up elbow weight even though a real coat hangs from the shoulders. This finds that bleed geometrically (a vertex carrying arm weight while sitt

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix Methane Apparatus Grab`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneApparatusGrab.cs`</sub>

Guarantee the methane apparatus is pick-up-able (user 2026-07-15: "I can't pick up the draw tubes"). Normalises every common grab-blocker on the hard-glass tube, collection tube and burner: active, on the Default layer, with an XRGrabInteractable (velocity-tracked + two-handed), a Rigidbody, a live convex collider, and the shelf/respawn policy. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix Methane Verbs (burner/match/reagent)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethanePlaytestFix.cs`</sub>

W5.12 playtest fixes (user 2026-07-13): the workspace burners had no BurnerController (couldn't be lit) and NOTHING in the scene was a MatchStrikerSurface (a match couldn't be struck), which blocked the whole heat step; and the Methane reagent jar had no LiquidPhysics so it couldn't be scooped/poured. This wires all three so the location-free Methane rig works: • every Bunsen/Alcohol burner gets BurnerController + MatchStrikerSurface (strike a match on the burner base to light it, then it lights

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix NPC Dialogue Height`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VrUiFixes.cs`</sub>

Two VR-UI scene fixes (user 2026-07-15). • Quiz answers unclickable: a world-space Canvas needs a TrackedDeviceGraphicRaycaster for the XR ray to hit it — a plain GraphicRaycaster is mouse-only. The scene had 10 GraphicRaycasters but only 3 tracked ones, so most panels (incl. the quiz) ignored the controller ray. • Dr. Jimenez's subtitles floated at local y=2.15 — above head height, up by the ceiling and unreadable. Lowered to just above his head. Both idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix Tripod Collider (open stand)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/FixTripodCollider.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the tripod is a STAND — the burner goes underneath, wire gauze + flask on top. But it was given a single CONVEX hull collider (required for a dynamic/grabbable body), which fills the open frame so nothing fits below. A tripod can't be both grabbable-dynamic AND hollow. This makes it a KINEMATIC stand with a NON-CONVEX mesh collider that matches the real open legs+ring, so the burner fits underneath and items rest on top. Still grabbable (moves while held), but it stays w

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Fix VR UI Raycasters (quiz clickable)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VrUiFixes.cs`</sub>

Two VR-UI scene fixes (user 2026-07-15). • Quiz answers unclickable: a world-space Canvas needs a TrackedDeviceGraphicRaycaster for the XR ray to hit it — a plain GraphicRaycaster is mouse-only. The scene had 10 GraphicRaycasters but only 3 tracked ones, so most panels (incl. the quiz) ignored the controller ray. • Dr. Jimenez's subtitles floated at local y=2.15 — above head height, up by the ceiling and unreadable. Lowered to just above his head. Both idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Generate Lab Surface Textures`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabSurfaceTextureForge.cs`</sub>

Generates the lab's MISSING surface textures (user 2026-08-28: "improve the textures to make it an aesthetic lab"; free-authoring route chosen, so no Unity AI credits are spent). The Laboratory pack left the two largest surfaces in the player's view with no albedo at all - Wall_0/Wall_1 carry a normal map and nothing else, and Ceiling_2 carries no maps whatsoever. A featureless white plane is exactly what makes the room read as an untextured grey box, and it is worst on the ceiling, which a seat

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Generate Materials Guides`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MaterialsGuideGenerator.cs`</sub>

Fills every module's MATERIALS guide (the watch-panel header, user 2026-07-17: "display all materials needed first, from reagents and apparatus… just there as a guide so the players can assemble them before they even proceed"). REAGENTS are DERIVED from the module's layout bindings — the ground truth of what the experiment actually consumes — with totals summed per chemical, so the guide can never drift from the tasks. Units follow the game's own convention (1 squeeze = 1 ml): liquids read "N ml

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Generate Raw Reagent Data`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RawReagentForge.cs`</sub>

Generates the ChemicalData assets for every RawReagentCatalog row that the game doesn't already know (matched by normalised chemicalName), stamps the HazardousMix flags from the shared HazardFlags rules, and registers everything in the SceneAssetLibrary so layouts and the cabinet builder resolve them. Consumable rows (SmallBox/IceBucket) are physical props, not chemicals — no SO is made for them. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Generate Reagent Labels`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabelForge.cs`</sub>

Reagent-label compositor (§3, client style pick: MODERN). For every Reagent_* bottle on the shelf: renders LabelBase_Modern + the chemical's name (crisp TMP text — never AI typography) to a PNG, builds a material, and mounts a label quad on the bottle facing the aisle. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Generate Reagent Labels — idempotent, re-run anytime.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Hide Station Pads`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HideStationPads.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the hand-built Methane station pads still render as coloured cubes on the table — the DynamicStage builder hides its own pads (padMr.enabled = false, W5.8) but the authored Station_* objects were missed. The pads are purely cosmetic: the trigger COLLIDER + sensors that detect each step stay, and the guides/labels tell the player where to act — so the cube mesh just clutters the view. This disables the MeshRenderer on every Station_* pad while leaving all functionality in

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Inject ILO Beats`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/IloBeatInjector.cs`</sub>

Injects each experiment's ILO beats into its Intro cutscene (user 2026-07-10: Pharmee states the learning outcomes in the opening dialogue). Beats slot in after the greeting beat: a lead-in, then one beat per objective (verbatim Appendix C copy from IloCopy). Idempotent — the lead-in text is the marker.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Lock My Layout`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LockMyLayout.cs`</sub>

One-click self-service layout lock (user 2026-07-13: "after I move or duplicate assets I just want one button"). Does everything needed to make a hand-arranged workspace permanent — with NO rebuilding, so it can never reset placements: 1. Tidy duplicate names  — "Beaker (1)" → "Beaker_100mL_2", + full interaction wiring for any raw duplicate that was missing it. 2. Re-home every item     — current transform becomes its respawn home (moved originals AND duplicates), so nothing snaps back in Play.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Make Methane Bench Tools Permanent`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneBenchPermanent.cs`</sub>

Make the methane bench TOOLS (mortar, pestle, scoopula, spatula) permanent fixtures — usable in BOTH Lab Tour and Campaign, all the time (user 2026-07-14: "the mortar must be usable for both modes all throughout"). They were parented under MethaneStage, which MethaneStageVisibility hides at play-start, so they vanished in Play. This lifts them OUT of the stage (world position preserved), makes sure they're active + rest kinematic (won't fall through the bench), and re-homes them so a Reset keeps

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Make Methane Location-Free`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneLocationFree.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): convert the Methane tutorial to LOCATION-FREE completion. Deletes the 5 fixed Station_* zone objects (no more standing on a pad), and rewires the MethaneApparatusRig to own its TemperatureSim + GasCollection so heat/collect/splint fire by item PROXIMITY anywhere, and prepare-mixture completes by grinding a mortar. Run once. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Make Spatula Porcelain`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SpatulaPorcelain.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user): the manuscript specifies a PORCELAIN spatula, but our Spatula prefab shipped with the shared metal EquipmentMat and read as steel. This finds every Spatula prefab instance in the scene (by SOURCE prefab, so it catches hand-placed/renamed copies like "Eq_Spatula" that carry no LabItem), applies the pack's white PorcelainMat, renames + labels it "Porcelain Spatula", gives it the full interaction wiring, and fixes the source prefab. Via the Mishandling table it now clinks like ceramic

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Merge Center Tables`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/CenterTableBuilder.cs`</sub>

Merge Center Tables (user 2026-07-10: "remove the other table; make the current one one single wide table, placed at the center, now in landscape"). The experiment layouts bake WORLD positions on the left island, so this is a one-time atomic migration: 1. discover both islands geometrically (raycast under the baked positions and at their x-mirror; climb to the Environment child), 2. deactivate the right island (+ its sink follows to the new short end), 3. rigid-remap the left island 90° to the l

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Methane: Find & Recover Bench Items`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneRecover.cs`</sub>

Diagnose + recover the methane bench items (user 2026-07-14: "the mortar is still missing from the table where I placed it"). A likely cause: an item was moved AFTER the last Lock My Layout, so its respawn home was stale and a Reset teleported it away (often below the floor). This reports every methane item's position + active state, reactivates + lifts anything that fell, and RE-HOMES them all at their current spot so the next Reset keeps them put.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Name Tubes + Build Rack Slots`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TubeRackSlotBuilder.cs`</sub>

TOGETHER WITH their kit holders, so every copy arrived already seated correctly relative to its rack. A first pass here also shipped a "Seat Tubes In Slots" menu that would have MOVED all 19 perfectly-placed tubes onto bounds-GUESSED slots and destroyed that placement — it is deleted. Never re-derive rack positions the scene already has right. Only the workspace holders need anchors, because they are the only racks that start EMPTY (the player drags tubes in mid-experiment), so there is no seate

is the whole reason it is the right tool on a Quest. The three steps that have to happen in THIS order, because each depends on the last: 1. Lightmap UVs. A mesh with no UV2 cannot receive a lightmap. 36 of the project's 107 models lacked them, including the entire room shell (Wall, Floor, Ceiling_2, the tables). Anything still missing UV2 after the import pass is set to receive from LIGHT PROBES instead, so it still occludes and bounces without a broken lightmap. 2. Static flags, filtered HARD.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Purge Stale Workspace Labels`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/WorkspaceLabelPurge.cs`</sub>

Removes the stale Methane-tutorial text labels that float over the center workspace (user 2026-07-12: "delete the texts still floating around the main workspace"). They were authored directly under WorldLabels (NOT under MethaneStage), so toggling the Methane stage never hid them, and the table-merge left them orphaned at the old x≈1.15 position. Pure scene leftovers — no script references them. Landmark labels (PPE locker, fume hood) and runtime DynLabel_* are kept. Idempotent + re-runnable.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Re-Home Scene Items (Adopt Current)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReHomeSceneItems.cs`</sub>

Adopts every scene item's CURRENT transform as its DropRespawn home (user 2026-07-10: "I have manually relocated some equipment, please make those their default spawn point"). Without this, manually moved props teleport back to their old serialized homes after ~25 s idle / a kill-Z fall / a reset. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Re-Home Scene Items (Adopt Current) — run in SampleScene edit mode after ANY manual re-arrangement, then save the scene.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Rebuild Compact HUD`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/CompactHudBuilder.cs`</sub>

Compact VR HUD layout (user 2026-07-11): the timer + title move OUT of the centre and merge into the Progress pill on the LEFT (small, stacked); the top cluster tucks to the top edge; the three Settings/Restart/Quit buttons collapse behind ONE hamburger icon that opens a vertical dropdown; and Pharmee's bottom dialogue bar is raised so it's fully in view. Idempotent — re-run after tuning the constants below. Operates on the open scene's HudRig (SampleScene only).

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Remove Lit Splint Prop`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RemoveLitSplint.cs`</sub>

Delete the wooden splint prop (user 2026-07-15, backed by a manuscript review): "splint" appears NOWHERE in the client manuscript — every combustion/flame test is run with a "lighted matchstick" (Exp 3: "apply a lighted matchstick... blue flame indicates complete combustion"). The methane gas test already fires off a lit Matchstick (MethaneApparatusRig.SplintShouldFire checks Matchstick), so the splint prop is redundant. The method names keep the "splint" wording (suite-pinned); only the prop go

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Remove Pipette (W5.12)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RemovePipette.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): drop the modern mechanical pipette — the Dropper (drops) + graduated cylinder (ml) already cover its manuscript role. Removes the scene instance, the SceneAssetLibrary registration, and the generated prefab. The raw MechanicalPipette model pack is left on disk (harmless). Idempotent; safe to run once.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Remove VR-Inappropriate Apparatus`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RemoveVrInappropriateApparatus.cs`</sub>

Deletes the SCENE INSTANCES of apparatus that the manuscript lists but that carry no meaningful VR interaction — pure bench scaffolding and passive instruments the game already abstracts (user 2026-07-17: "they should be removed even from the table, but not from the folders just in case"). ⛔ DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED EXCEPTION to the "ALL tools always present" client rule. These six are NOT a decluttering of usable tools — each is either a support rig the zone-free heat model made unnecessary or an

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Restore All Bench Items`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RestoreBenchItems.cs`</sub>

Re-activate every bench item that was hidden (client rule 2026-07-15: ALL tools and reagents are present across ALL experiments — nothing is ever hidden or removed per-experiment). Undoes any accidental deactivation. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Reveal Methane + Waypoint (for editing)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RevealMethaneAndWaypoint.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): reveal the Methane set + the waypoint marker in the editor so the user can hand-align them, and permanently strip the waypoint's yellow ground glow (keep only the arrow). The Methane STATIONS carry the step-detection zones AND are what the waypoint arrow follows, so moving them with the props is how both detection and the arrow get aimed correctly.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Reveal Methane Stage (for review)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RevealMethaneStage.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the Methane tutorial stage is authored inactive (m_IsActive:0) so it stays hidden in the editor. The user wants to review / delete it by hand, so this switches it (and any other hidden methane roots) ON in edit mode and lists what became visible. Runtime is unaffected — ExperimentSceneBuilder still SetActive(moduleId==methane) each build. ⚠ Deleting these breaks Experiment 1 until Methane is rewired to build on the workspace (the splint-pop rig especially is wired to the

Seals the skybox seams the user reported at BOTH entrances (front corridor door + interior lab door, 2026-07-10). Each doorway's frame doesn't quite meet the surrounding wall, so the skybox shows through thin cracks at the jambs/lintel. This wraps each doorway with opaque trim strips (top lintel + two jambs) centred on the wall plane and standing slightly proud on both faces, so the seam is covered whether viewed from the corridor or the lab. Reuses GapSealWall's dark material for a consistent l

Edit-mode helper (user 2026-07-11: "let me manually reposition the sinks, speaker, tables and shelves in the editor"). Two blockers were stopping Scene-view clicks: 1. The Environment furniture (tables, wall cabinets, wash-table sinks) had PICKING DISABLED (the pointer toggle in the Hierarchy) — same reason the stools couldn't be clicked. 2. Some fixtures (the LabSpeaker, and the shelf ROOTS that sit at the origin with their meshes parented elsewhere) had no click target, so a click selected a c

Edit-mode helper (user 2026-07-10: "let me select + reposition the stools in the editor, not in Play mode"). The stools sit tucked under the tables, so clicking them in a crowded Scene view is fiddly. This selects all of them in one go — then move them with the transform gizmo and run Re-Home Scene Items to make it stick. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Select Stools (edit mode).

Simulates the player who gets it WRONG. Every other simulator plays a flawless run, which answers "does correct play work?". It does not answer the question that actually decides whether nine experiments are doable by a student: **after a mistake, can they still finish?** A contaminated vessel, an out-of-order attempt or an exhausted bottle that quietly makes a run unfinishable looks identical to a clean sim — the perfect path never touches it.

Re-seats every experiment layout onto the LayoutTidyMath zoning grid (W5.8: clean center table — stations across the back, vessels center-front, reagents right, tools left; the front strip stays free for the rack and spares). Deterministic + idempotent; also structurally removes the two historical clamped overlaps at (1.38, −3.88) in Acetone and Benzamide. Run AFTER `Apply W5.8 Verb Data` so new stations/props get slots too.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Tune Lab Surfaces`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabSurfaceTuner.cs`</sub>

single most obviously wrong thing in the room. * The four vessel materials the player handles constantly - beaker 100/500, Erlenmeyer, graduated cylinder - sat at smoothness 0. Glass with NO specular and NO reflection is why they read as pale plastic blobs. The same pack ships CORRECT glass values on GlassMat/GlassInnerMat/GlassOuterMat (0.92-0.95), so the right answer was already sitting next to the wrong one. * Several non-metals sat at metallic 0 + smoothness 1 - a physically impossible "non-

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Tune Render Pipeline`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabRenderTuner.cs`</sub>

* MSAA was 1 (off). On the Adreno tile GPU 4x resolves in tile memory and is close to free, and this scene is nothing but thin edges - tube rims, glass rods, rack rails. It is the largest per-pixel quality gain available. * HDR was off, so emission above 1.0 just clamped: the 16 emissive ceiling panels could never read as LIGHTS, only as white paint, and tonemapping had no range to work with. * Ambient was FLAT grey 0.45 - identical from every direction, so nothing in the room had any vertical s

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Upgrade Distilling Flask Glass`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DistillingFlaskGlass.cs`</sub>

W5.12: the DistillingFlask model (glTFast .glb) imported with a bare grey metallic material, so it read as a chrome flask instead of glass. This swaps every mesh on the scene flask (and its prefab) to the SAME borosilicate glass materials the ChemLab beakers use, so it matches the rest of the glassware. Idempotent; run from SampleScene edit mode.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Voice/Export Voice Manifest`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceManifestExporter.cs`</sub>

Exports the full voice-over manifest (user 2026-07-10: NPCs speak): every code-authored line (VoiceCorpus) plus every cutscene beat, one row per unique (speaker, text) with its stable id. Tools/voice/generate-voice.ps1 consumes the manifest; changed lines re-key and regenerate individually.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Voice/Fix Voice Audibility + Music Ducking`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceAudioBuilder.cs`</sub>

Makes the generated voice-over actually AUDIBLE and well-behaved (2026-07-27). Three separate faults, one pass: 1. Dr. Jimenez was silent. His narration channel had NO narratorAudioSource, and SayRoutine only plays a clip when one exists — so every one of his 37 lines fell straight through to the placeholder blips. 2. Voices were fully 3D, so they faded to nothing a couple of metres away. The client wants them heard across the room but LOUDER up close, which is a partial spatial blend: the 2D sh

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Voice/Import & Wire Voice Clips`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceImportTool.cs`</sub>

Imports the generated voice clips and wires the bank into the scene: 1. Quest-friendly import settings on Audio/Voice/** (mono, Vorbis). 2. Rebuilds VoiceBank.asset from Audio/Voice/<Speaker>/<id>.mp3|wav. 3. Points every NPCNarrationController in the open scene at the bank — controllers under Dr. Jimenez speak as Jimenez, everything else as Pharmee. Missing clips keep today's blip+typewriter. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Voice/Polish Cutscene Copy for Recording`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoicePolish.cs`</sub>

Pre-recording copy pass over the CUTSCENE beats (2026-07-27). Every beat is a SUBTITLE **and** a text-to-speech script, so a line can be perfectly good on screen and wrong in the ear — or, worse, describe apparatus that no longer exists. Run this before spending voice credits: changing a line changes its VoiceLineId, so the manifest must be re-exported afterwards anyway. Edits the assets through SerializedObject rather than the YAML, because these subtitles contain ": " (e.g. "Welcome back! Toda

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Voice/Sync Gate Dialogue to Code`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoicePolish.cs`</sub>

The gate's dialogue is a [SerializeField], so the SCENE keeps its own copy of every line and that copy is what the player actually hears. Any edit to the code defaults silently fails to reach the game, and — because the voice manifest is built from the CODE — the spoken text stops matching any clip and the line drops back to placeholder blips (user 2026-07-27: "some dialogs of Pharmee are still the robot beep, that 'Hold on...' one"). The scene copy had drifted badly: it still asked for a lab co

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Button Sounds`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ButtonSoundsBuilder.cs`</sub>

Adds UiButtonSounds (hover blip + click) to every UI Button in the OPEN scene (user 2026-07-10). Run it once per scene — MainMenu (cube room) and SampleScene (HUD / choice panels / settings / grade / post-lab). Idempotent. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Wire Button Sounds (edit mode).

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Distillation Apparatus (W5.12)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DistillationApparatusWiring.cs`</sub>

W5.12: wires the distillation-completion apparatus into the game — the 6 AI-generated pieces (Condenser, RubberStopper, DeliveryTube, WaterBath, UtilityClamp, Aspirator) plus the 3 that existed only as raw models (Pipette, Thermometer, FlorenceFlask). Each is prefabbed if needed, registered in the SceneAssetLibrary, and one instance is spawned + fully wired + placed in a tidy row beside the distilling flask (the user then nudges + re-homes). Idempotent. Size/physics/breakage live in the code tab

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire End-Product Gate`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/EndProductGateBuilder.cs`</sub>

A ready-made GOAL destroys the experiment (user 2026-07-11 / 2026-07-16) — attaches EndProductVisibility to both storage roots and binds the runner, so each product bottle SetActive(false)s WHILE ITS OWN MODULE RUNS. The gate is per-EXPERIMENT, not per-chemical: Ethanol, Acetone and Benzoic Acid are each some module's goal AND a manuscript-listed reagent for others, so a global hide stripped Exp 2 (which runs before Exp 3/6) of reagents it needs. The four PURE products were deleted from the shel

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Grab Collision (VelocityTracking)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/GrabMovementTools.cs`</sub>

Applies the GrabTuning velocity-tracked profile to every grabbable so held items collide with the world (user 2026-07-10: props could be pushed through walls/floor). Covers the SceneAssetLibrary prefabs (persisted) AND every XRGrabInteractable in the open scene(s) (catches instance overrides, stools, shelf bottles). Idempotent — re-running reports 0 changes.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Grade Back Button (W5.9)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/GradeBackButtonBuilder.cs`</sub>

W5.9: the fail path used to trap the player in a Retry-only loop — this wires a "Complete Experiment" button onto the grade screen (shown only on FAIL, where Continue is hidden — they share the slot) that ends the attempt and returns the player to the entrance, where any unlocked experiment can be picked. Label renamed from "Choose Another" (user 2026-07-15). Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Methane Stage Visibility`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneStageVisibilityBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the MethaneStageVisibility controller (user 2026-07-13: methane set present only in Lab Tour + the Methane attempt). Puts the component on ExperimentSystems (a manager that keeps running while the stage is hidden), binds the MethaneStage + runner + LabTourGuide, and re-hides the stage in the authored scene so it doesn't flash on lab entry. Idempotent.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire NPC Polish`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabNpcPolishBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the 2026-07-10 NPC/audio polish batch into SampleScene: 1. Pharmee expressions — PharmeeFace re-pointed at the robot's EYES + MOUTH meshes (was Ears_Black_Matt_0), default-happy; PharmeeMood resets the face after every line; the gatekeeper's faceBehaviour drives gate moods. 2. Dr. Jimenez proctor roaming — ProctorRoamer + observation points at the reagent shelf, equipment shelf, dynamic stage and fume hood. 3. AC proximity hum — ProximityHum on the air-con / vent assets (falls back to the 

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Scoop Sounds`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ScoopSoundWiring.cs`</sub>

Wire the generated solid-material SFX into the SoundBank (user 2026-07-15: "scooping powder still sounds like liquid"). The scoop verb calls the "scoop" and "powder-pour" keys via AudioService.TryPlayFirstAt, which deliberately has NO liquid fallback — so these clips are what make it audible. Clips generated with elevenlabs-sound-effects-v2 into Audio/Generated/. Idempotent: updates the entries in place if they already exist.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Shelf Pourers`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ShelfPourBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the hand-placed reagent bottles for visible pouring (user 2026-07-10: tipping a shelf bottle showed nothing — LiquidPourer only existed on runtime-spawned props). Sweeps every LiquidPhysics under the ReagentShelf (and, once batch H lands, ReagentCabinets) root through ShelfPourWiring.WireBottle, and ensures the persisted particle material asset exists so device builds don't strip the URP particle shader. Idempotent — re-running reports 0 additions.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Spawn Height (Fixed Per Scene)`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SpawnHeightWiring.cs`</sub>

Wires the fixed per-scene eye height onto the open scene's XR rig (user 2026-07-11: menu room and lab need DIFFERENT fixed heights, not relative to the player's real height). Run once per scene (MainMenu + SampleScene). Idempotent. Tune the two constants below and re-run to adjust.

### `Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire VR Affordances`
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VrAffordanceBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the 2026-07-10 VR affordance batch into the open scene: 1. HAPTICS — every hand interactor (NearFar + Poke) gets a HapticImpulsePlayer + SimpleHapticFeedback so grabbing, socket-snapping and poking UI buzz. 2. HOVER HIGHLIGHT — every grabbable gets a HoverHighlight so it brightens + pops when a hand/ray hovers it (small real-scale tools are easy to find). 3. SOCKET GHOST — every station socket shows a translucent preview of the correct item snapped in place. (Runtime-spawned experiment pro
