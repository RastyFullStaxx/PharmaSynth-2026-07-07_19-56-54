## Experiment

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/`

### `DemoActions` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/DemoActions.cs`</sub>

Demo-session auto-complete verbs (pure statics over existing runner/quiz seams — no gate-state coupling, so they survive flow redesigns). Used by the demo HUD buttons so panelists can sweep through an experiment quickly.

```csharp
static string CompleteCurrentStep(ExperimentRunner runner)
static int CompleteAllTasks(ExperimentRunner runner)
static bool AutoAnswerQuiz(PostLabController postLab)
```

### `ExperimentModuleDefinition` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/ExperimentModuleDefinition.cs`</sub>

```csharp
string moduleId
string moduleTitle
List<string> intendedLearningOutcomes
List<string> materialReagents
List<string> materialApparatus
List<ExperimentTaskDefinition> tasks
List<ExperimentTask> graphTasks
bool assessmentMode
float masteryThreshold
BktParameters bkt
List<LabSkill> trackedSkills
RubricWeights rubricWeights
float parTimeSeconds
TaskGraph BuildTaskGraph()
```

### `ExperimentTaskDefinition` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/ExperimentModuleDefinition.cs`</sub>

```csharp
string taskId
string taskLabel
int scoreValue
bool requiredForCompletion
```

### `ExperimentResult` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/ExperimentRunner.cs`</sub>

Outcome of an experiment attempt, consumed by the grade screen and progression gate.

```csharp
GradeBreakdown grade
float overallMastery
bool gradePassed
bool masteryPassed
bool passed
int mistakeCount
float elapsedSeconds
float quizScore01
```

### `ExperimentRunner` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/ExperimentRunner.cs`</sub>

Runtime orchestrator for a single experiment attempt. Owns the TaskGraph, BKT MasteryModel, MistakeLog and grader built from an ExperimentModuleDefinition, and raises the events the HUD / tablet / wrist-watch / grade screen subscribe to. All scoring/mastery logic lives in the (unit-tested) pure classes; this is thin glue plus per-frame time + auto-check. Drives the v2 TaskGraph data model — the sole runner since the legacy ExperimentFlowManager cluster was deleted (2026-08-07); it had been in no scene or prefab, and its callers reached it through `?.`, so every one of them had been silently doing nothing.

```csharp
UnityEvent onExperimentStarted
UnityEvent onExperimentFinished
event Action<ExperimentModuleDefinition> ExperimentPrepared
event Action<ExperimentModuleDefinition> ExperimentStarted
event Action<ExperimentTask> TaskCompleted
event Action<TaskPhase> PhaseCompleted
event Action<float> ProgressChanged
event Action<LabErrorType, string> MistakeRecorded
event Action<ExperimentResult> ExperimentFinished
bool IsRunning
bool IsArmed
float ElapsedSeconds
float Progress01
int MistakeCount
```

### `LabErrorType` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/MistakeLog.cs`</sub>

The full error taxonomy the safety/error matrix reports (plan §3.7). Extends the inherited 4 hardcoded penalties (wrong step/reagent/glass/fire) with the missing overheat, PPE, fume-hood and chemical-contact cases.

### `MistakeLog` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/MistakeLog.cs`</sub>

Records mistakes during an experiment attempt and exposes counts. (Audit gap: the legacy FlowManager fired a MistakeRecorded event but never kept a count — the grade screen needs "Number of Mistakes".) Plain C# so it is unit-testable and reusable by both the legacy FlowManager and the new experiment runner.

```csharp
event Action<LabErrorType, string> MistakeRecorded
int Count
void Record(LabErrorType type, string message)
int CountOf(LabErrorType type)
int CountOfAny(params LabErrorType[] types)
void Clear()
static RubricCategory CategoryFor(LabErrorType type)
static LabSkill SkillFor(LabErrorType type)
```

### `QuizQuestion` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/QuizBank.cs`</sub>

A post-lab multiple-choice question (tablet "Documentation" phase). Client-reviewable content — kept as data so questions can be edited without code changes.

```csharp
List<string> options
int correctIndex
string explanation
bool IsValid()
```

### `QuizBank` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/QuizBank.cs`</sub>

The 3-question post-lab quiz for one experiment (manual's "Documentation" criterion, VR-feasible form). One asset per module, keyed by moduleId.

```csharp
string moduleId
List<QuizQuestion> questions
int Count
float Score(IReadOnlyList<int> answers)
bool AllValid()
```

### `QuizBankLibrary` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/QuizBankLibrary.cs`</sub>

Runtime-safe moduleId → QuizBank lookup (serialized direct references so it works in a build). One asset holds every experiment's post-lab quiz; the PostLabController asks it for the bank matching the running module.

```csharp
List<QuizBank> banks
QuizBank GetBank(string moduleId)
```

### `TaskGraph` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/TaskGraph.cs`</sub>

Runtime engine that drives an experiment's tasks: enforces prerequisites, tracks weighted progress, raises phase/completion events, and auto-completes tasks whose registered world-state condition becomes true. Plain C# (not a MonoBehaviour) so it is unit-testable in isolation; a thin scene component owns one of these and forwards trigger/condition events to it.

```csharp
event Action<ExperimentTask> TaskCompleted
event Action<TaskPhase> PhaseCompleted
event Action AllRequiredCompleted
TaskGraph(IEnumerable<ExperimentTask> tasks)
IReadOnlyList<ExperimentTask> Tasks
bool IsComplete(string taskId)
bool HasPhase(TaskPhase phase)
bool PrerequisitesMet(string taskId)
bool IsAvailable(string taskId)
IEnumerable<ExperimentTask> AvailableTasks()
void RegisterCondition(string taskId, Func<bool> condition)
bool HasCondition(string taskId)
void Tick()
TaskCompletionResult TryComplete(string taskId)
```

### `TaskPhase` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/TaskGraphModel.cs`</sub>

The four graded phases every experiment moves through (plan §3.2).

### `LabSkill` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/TaskGraphModel.cs`</sub>

Reusable lab competencies tracked by the Bayesian mastery model (plan §3.6).

### `RubricCategory` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/TaskGraphModel.cs`</sub>

Rubric criteria that the grade is composed from (WCC lab manual rubric, plan §3.6).

### `TaskCompletionResult` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/TaskGraphModel.cs`</sub>

Result of attempting to complete a task — drives the error matrix (BlockedByPrerequisite is the canonical "wrong step order" signal).

### `ExperimentTask` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Experiment/TaskGraphModel.cs`</sub>

One node in a module's TaskGraph. A task becomes available once every prerequisite task is complete; it can then be completed by a world-state condition (auto-check) or an explicit trigger/event.

```csharp
string taskId
string label
TaskPhase phase
List<string> prerequisites
float progressWeight
LabSkill skill
RubricCategory rubricCategory
bool required
string hint
bool autoCompleteWhenOthersDone
bool longProcess
string longProcessMessage
```

## Chemistry

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/`

### `PhysicalState` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ChemicalData.cs`</sub>

### `HazardType` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ChemicalData.cs`</sub>

Hazard class — drives spill/contact feedback and the fume-hood requirement.

### `ChemicalData` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ChemicalData.cs`</sub>

```csharp
string chemicalName
PhysicalState state
Color liquidColor
Color liquidTopColor
float sceneColourAmount
float viscosity
float boilingPointC
Color precipitateColor
bool evolvesGas
HazardType hazard
bool requiresFumeHood
bool isDangerous
bool isOxidizer
bool isConcentratedAcid
```

### `CrystallizationController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/CrystallizationController.cs`</sub>

Timed crystallization: after BeginCrystallization(), a liquid gradually turns to solid crystals over a duration (e.g. aspirin/benzoic acid on ice). Cross- fades a crystal renderer in as it progresses; fires Crystallized when done and exposes a TaskGraph auto-check predicate. Timestep-driven, deterministically tested.

```csharp
UnityEvent onCrystallized
event Action Crystallized
float Progress
bool IsDone
void BeginCrystallization()
void Tick(float dt)
bool Crystallized01(float fraction)
void ResetProcess()
```

### `EndProductVisibility` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/EndProductVisibility.cs`</sub>

Benzoic Acid — goal of Exp 4, and its own reference sample Exp 2 runs BEFORE Exp 3 and Exp 6, so a global per-chemical hide (what this did until 2026-07-16) removed reagents Exp 2 cannot proceed without. Hiding only the running module's own product keeps both rules true: you never get your goal handed to you, and every experiment still has its inputs. The four PURE products — Acetanilide, Benzamide, Chloroform, Wine — are named as a reagent by no manuscript procedure, so they are not stocked at all rather than gated (see EndProductShelfStocker). Lives on a storage ROOT (ReagentShelf / ReagentCabinets) — the root stays active so this keeps running, and gated bottles are fully SetActive(false) so the supply monitor, hover cards and grabs all ignore them. Play-mode only: in the editor everything stays visible for arranging, and Unity restores the authored state when Play ends.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r)
static string HiddenProductFor(string moduleId, bool demoActive)
int Rescan()
int Apply(string hiddenChemical)
```

### `FiltrationController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/FiltrationController.cs`</sub>

Filtration (gravity / Büchner): filtrate accumulates as the player pours/pumps the mixture through. Tracks a 0..1 fraction toward a target volume, fires Filtered when complete, and exposes a TaskGraph auto-check predicate.

```csharp
UnityEvent onFiltered
event Action Filtered
event Action<float> FilteredChanged
float Fraction
bool IsDone
void AddFiltrate(float ml)
bool Filtered01(float fraction)
void ResetProcess()
```

### `GasCollection` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/GasCollection.cs`</sub>

Collects evolved gas over a run (e.g. CH4 over water, CO2 into a balloon or limewater). Tracks a 0..1 fill fraction that drives a balloon scale / bubble VFX, fires an event when full, and exposes a TaskGraph auto-check predicate.

```csharp
UnityEvent onFull
event Action Full
event Action<float> FillChanged
float FillFraction
bool IsFull
void AddGas(float ml)
bool Collected(float fraction)
void ResetCollection()
```

### `HazardFlags` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/HazardFlags.cs`</sub>

Pure name-based hazard-flag rules for ChemicalData (one table shared by the editor audit menu, the raw-reagent forge, and the self-tests). Names are the stable key — the chemistry SOs are authored per display name.

```csharp
static bool IsOxidizer(string chemicalName)
static bool IsConcentratedAcid(string chemicalName)
```

### `HazardousMix` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/HazardousMix.cs`</sub>

Pure classification of chemically-BAD mixes (user 2026-07-10: wrong mixtures showed nothing — no smoke, fire, colour, or penalty). Runs on the existing LiquidPhysics.WrongReagentMixed seam, i.e. only for A+B pairs with NO registered ReactionRule (real chemistry always wins). Direction-aware: `current` is what's in the vessel, `incoming` is what got poured in. Everything stays isolated in-sim per the manuscript ("dangerous conditions isolated without risk") — effects + penalty, never player harm.

### `HazardOutcome` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/HazardousMix.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static HazardOutcome Classify(ChemicalData current, ChemicalData incoming)
static bool IsAcid(ChemicalData c)
static bool IsHypochloriteLike(ChemicalData c)
static LabErrorType ErrorTypeFor(HazardOutcome o)
static string WarnLineFor(HazardOutcome o)
static Color TintFor(HazardOutcome o, ChemicalData current)
```

### `HazardousMixReactor` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/HazardousMixReactor.cs`</sub>

Scene driver for HazardousMix: subscribes to a vessel's WrongReagentMixed (the previously-silent no-rule mix) and stages the consequence — outcome VFX at the vessel, positional SFX, the lab alarm + warning vignette for the dangerous ones, and the graded mistake. One reaction per vessel per 2 s so a continuous pour doesn't spam penalties. Attached by ExperimentSceneBuilder (vessels + pourables) and ShelfPourWiring (shelf/cabinet bottles).

```csharp
const float CooldownSeconds
void Bind(LiquidPhysics liquid, ExperimentRunner runner)
```

### `LiquidPassthrough` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/LiquidPassthrough.cs`</sub>

Marker: a pour STREAM passes straight through this object (funnels). Without it, LiquidPourer.ResolveTarget treated the funnel's collider as the landing surface — no LiquidPhysics there, so the hydrolysate the manuscript says to filter was WASTED as a puddle on top of the funnel and the beaker below stayed empty, leaving the FeCl3 filtrate test nothing to react with (found by the 2026-07-17 player-path simulation). The ray continues to the receiving vessel underneath, which is what a funnel is for. It also OWNS the funnel's visual: the stream disappears into the cone and re-emerges as a thin trickle from the stem's hole (user 2026-07-27: "make the water flowing through it appear from its hole below"). Runtime-only and self-building — no scene authoring beyond the component.

```csharp
Transform spout
Vector3 SpoutPoint
bool IsFlowing
void Flow(Color tint)
```

### `LiquidPhysics` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/LiquidPhysics.cs`</sub>

```csharp
event Action<ChemicalData, float> LiquidAdded
event Action<ChemicalData, float> LiquidRejected
event Action<ReactionRule> ReactionOccurred
event Action<ChemicalData, ChemicalData> WrongReagentMixed
event Action<ReactionRule> ReactionPending
Renderer mainRenderer
Renderer precipitateRenderer
float maxVolume
float currentLiquidVolume
float currentPptVolume
float HorizonalFloatAdj
ChemicalData currentChemical
ChemicalData currentPptChemical
ReactionRegistry registry
```

### `LiquidPourer` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/LiquidPourer.cs`</sub>

```csharp
Transform spout
LineRenderer streamLine
float pourThreshold
float maxFlowRate
int streamSegments
float streamDropStrength
float flowSmoothingSpeed
float minStreamWidth
float maxStreamWidth
GameObject acidSpillPrefab
float spillCooldown
float assistRadius
static bool DebugOverlay
static float PourVolume(bool pouring, float baseVol, float catVol, float flow01)
```

### `LiquidTaskBinding` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/LiquidTaskBinding.cs`</sub>

Bridges a vessel's LiquidPhysics chemistry events to the experiment logic in a context-aware way: adding a reagent completes the task that expects it (the TaskGraph's prerequisite check enforces order), while a reagent no step expects is a genuine wrong-reagent mistake. Steps may require a MINIMUM poured amount (requiredMl) — deliveries accumulate until the threshold is met, so a one-frame splash no longer completes a step (client depletion mechanic, 2026-07-09).

### `ReagentStep` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/LiquidTaskBinding.cs`</sub>

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<ReagentStep> ExpectedSteps
bool IsListening
void SetFumeHood(FumeHoodZone hood)
bool InFumeHood()
void Detach()
void HandleReagent(ChemicalData chem)
void HandleReagent(ChemicalData chem, float amountMl)
static bool MetThreshold(float have, float required)
bool ReadyFor(string taskId)
float AccumulatedFor(string taskId)
float AccumulatedFor(string taskId, ChemicalData reagent)
int StepsRemaining(string taskId)
ReagentStep StepForReagent(ChemicalData chem)
string TaskForReagent(ChemicalData chem)
```

### `OverheatEffects` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/OverheatEffects.cs`</sub>

Overheat consequence at a Heat station (user 2026-07-10 error-effects pass): when the station's TemperatureSim crosses its overheat threshold, the vessel on the pad starts SMOKING, its contents turn into a ruined dark mixture, the alarm fires, and an Overheat mistake is recorded. Attached per Heat station by ExperimentSceneBuilder.

```csharp
void Bind(TemperatureSim sim, ExperimentRunner runner, ChemicalData ruined)
```

### `PowderPhysics` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/PowderPhysics.cs`</sub>

```csharp
Transform powderMesh
Renderer powderRenderer
float maxVolume
float currentPowderVolume
ChemicalData currentChemical
void AddPowder(ChemicalData incomingChemical, float amountToAdd)
ChemicalData PourOut(float amountToRemove)
```

### `PowderPourer` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/PowderPourer.cs`</sub>

```csharp
Transform spout
ParticleSystem powderStreamParticles
float pourThreshold
float maxFlowRate
```

### `RackMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/RackTaskGroup.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for a rack of tubes that share one step (2026-07-16). Manuscript Exp 2 runs the same test across a SET of tubes — five alcohols for the enol test, three butyl alcohols beside a negative control, acetone beside acetaldehyde, hydrolysed beside unhydrolysed aspirin. In every case **the comparison across the tubes IS the lesson**, so the step is only done when every tube that the step names has had its reagent. This exists because LiquidTaskBinding is per-VESSEL: give five tubes a binding for the same task and the first tube to hit its threshold completes it, quietly making the other four optional and throwing the lesson away. The rack members are authored completesTask:false (so their pours are expected and accumulate, but completion is not theirs) and the group calls it in.

```csharp
static bool AllReady(int readyTubes, int memberTubes)
static string ProgressLabel(int readyTubes, int memberTubes)
static int CountReady(IReadOnlyList<LiquidTaskBinding> members, string taskId)
```

### `RackTaskGroup` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/RackTaskGroup.cs`</sub>

Completes one task when every tube in its rack has had what the step asked of it. Thin driver over RackMath; poll-based so it needs no event plumbing into LiquidTaskBinding (which already tracks its own readiness).

```csharp
int MemberCount
string TaskId
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, string task, List<LiquidTaskBinding> tubes)
bool ShouldFire()
```

### `RawReagentCatalog` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/RawReagentCatalog.cs`</sub>

THE manuscript materials table (user 2026-07-10: the shelf stocked mostly end-products; Appendix C names ~54 distinct materials — raw precursors, prepared solutions and small consumables — that must exist in the lab). One row per manuscript material, each mapped to nature-appropriate labware. Source of truth for: ChemicalData generation (RawReagentForge), the cabinet stocking pass (ReagentCabinetBuilder), hover-info blurbs (LabInfoDatabase fallback) and the demo ready-made kits. Pure + test-pinned.

### `LabwareKind` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/RawReagentCatalog.cs`</sub>

### `Row` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/RawReagentCatalog.cs`</sub>

```csharp
const string GroupAcids
const string GroupOrganics
const string GroupTests
const string GroupConsumables
static IReadOnlyList<Row> Rows
static Row Find(string chemicalName)
static string BlurbFor(string chemicalName)
```

### `ReactionRegistry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ReactionRegistry.cs`</sub>

```csharp
List<ReactionRule> rules
ReactionRule FindReaction(ChemicalData a, ChemicalData b)
```

### `ReactionOutcome` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ReactionRule.cs`</sub>

Observable outcome of a reaction — the gradeable signal a chemical test checks for.

### `ReactionRule` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ReactionRule.cs`</sub>

```csharp
ChemicalData inputChemicalA
ChemicalData inputChemicalB
ChemicalData resultLiquid
ChemicalData resultPrecipitate
bool hasPrecipitate
float minTemperatureC
ReactionOutcome outcome
bool evolvesGas
string expectedObservation
bool TemperatureSatisfied(float currentTemperatureC)
```

### `ReagentSupplyMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ReagentSupplyMonitor.cs`</sub>

Pure shortfall analysis: which incomplete pour-steps can no longer be finished because the remaining supply of their reagent (summed across all bottles) is less than what the step still needs. Edit-mode testable.

### `Need` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ReagentSupplyMonitor.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static List<string> FindShortfalls(IEnumerable<Need> needs,
```

### `ReagentSupplyMonitor` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ReagentSupplyMonitor.cs`</sub>

Watches the live stage while an experiment runs: if a required pour-step can no longer be satisfied by the reagent left in the scene's bottles, it raises SupplyExhausted (once per attempt) so Pharmee can offer the restart.

```csharp
event Action<List<string>> SupplyExhausted
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void Unlatch(float graceSeconds
bool Latched
void ForceLatch()
static int RefillSourceBottles()
List<string> EvaluateNow()
```

### `ShelfPourWiring` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/ShelfPourWiring.cs`</sub>

Pour wiring for HAND-PLACED bottles (user 2026-07-10: tipping a reagent-shelf bottle showed no stream/puddle). ExperimentSceneBuilder wires runtime-spawned pourables, but the 16 shelf display bottles (and batch-H cabinet stock) are scene objects with LiquidPhysics only. This mirrors the builder's pourable block for an existing bottle, idempotently, callable from the editor menu (Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Wire Shelf Pourers) and from runtime builders. Edit-mode note: SpillMistake/LiquidPourer self-bind in Awake/Start at play time, so edit-mode wiring only has to ADD the components and set the serialized fields (registry, spout); the runner param matters only for runtime callers.

```csharp
static int WireBottle(GameObject bottle, ExperimentRunner runner, ReactionRegistry registry)
```

### `HeatModel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/TemperatureSim.cs`</sub>

Exact exponential heat model: temperature approaches the heat source (when heating) or ambient (when cooling). Stable for any timestep, so it is deterministically unit-testable. Powers distillation cut-offs (56 °C acetone, 70-80 °C ethanol) and the aspirin overheat branch.

```csharp
float Ambient
float HeatRate
float CoolRate
float Current
HeatModel(float ambient
void SetHeating(bool on, float sourceTemp)
void Step(float dt)
```

### `TemperatureSim` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/TemperatureSim.cs`</sub>

Per-vessel temperature with target-reached and overheat threshold events, plus a condition predicate for TaskGraph auto-check. Thin wrapper over HeatModel.

```csharp
UnityEvent onReachedTarget
UnityEvent onOverheated
event Action ReachedTarget
event Action Overheated
float CurrentC
bool IsOverheated
void SetHeating(bool on, float sourceTemp)
void Tick(float dt)
bool AtLeast(float temperatureC)
void ResetSim()
```

### `VesselLedger` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Chemistry/VesselLedger.cs`</sub>

Pure, testable record of what went into a vessel (W5.8 feedback layer). Display-only — chemistry stays in LiquidPhysics/ReactionRegistry; this just remembers the story so hover cards and mix feedback can say "Ethanol 120 ml + NaOH 50 ml" or "Reacted -> Acetanilide". Volumes are per-chemical totals; a reaction collapses the story to the product (matching what the vessel now holds), keeping summaries short after multi-step syntheses.

```csharp
int Count
System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<string> Names
void Add(string chemicalName, float ml, bool solid
void React(string resultName)
void Clear()
void Scale(float frac)
string Summary(int max
```

## Interaction

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/`

### `SnapAnchor` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ApparatusSnap.cs`</sub>

Where a part seats on its host when snapped.

### `AssemblyMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ApparatusSnap.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for apparatus assemblies (W5.12, user: "apparatus that should be together stick when brought close; grab moves the WHOLE group preserving formation; the ACTIVATE click detaches — never grab"). The part→host table mirrors the real heating rigs the manuscript implies plus the watch-glass cover the user called out. Kept plain so the suite pins the pairs + seats.

```csharp
const float SnapRadius
static bool CanAttach(string partPrefab, string hostPrefab)
static bool TryAnchor(string partPrefab, string hostPrefab, out SnapAnchor anchor)
static bool Participates(string prefabName)
static Vector3 SeatCenter(SnapAnchor anchor, Bounds host, Bounds part)
```

### `ApparatusSnap` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ApparatusSnap.cs`</sub>

Runtime snap behaviour: releasing a part near a compatible host attaches it (parented, kinematic, formation preserved — grabbing ANY member's mesh grabs the whole assembly via collider forwarding). The ACTIVATE click on the held assembly pops the most recently attached part back off. Added by PhysicsAudit.WireSceneItem / the kits builder for participating apparatus.

```csharp
ApparatusSnap AttachedTo
readonly List<ApparatusSnap> Attached
string PrefabName
void Bind(string prefab, XRGrab grab, Rigidbody rb)
ApparatusSnap Root()
void Attach(ApparatusSnap host, SnapAnchor anchor)
bool DetachNewest()
void Detach()
```

### `AtmosphereVfx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/AtmosphereVfx.cs`</sub>

Ambient lab atmosphere (user 2026-07-10): gentle white vapour so the room feels alive — a cool stream sinking from the AC unit, and faint slow-drifting haze near the floor/ceiling. Procedural (shares EffectVfx's soft-dot material, no asset deps) and deliberately LOW-density — transparent smoke is the main overdraw cost on Quest, so counts + alpha are kept small. Built + played on Start; placed by AtmosphereBuilder.

### `Style` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/AtmosphereVfx.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static string StyleName(Style s)
void Bind(Style s)
void Bind(Style s, Vector3 hazeSize)
void Build()
```

### `BreakableGlassware` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/BreakableGlassware.cs`</sub>

Glassware that shatters when dropped hard (§2 mishandling penalties). Only a FREE (dynamic, un-held) item can break — kinematic shelf items and items currently in a hand never do, no matter how they scrape a wall. On break: shatter SFX, a DroppedGlassware mistake against the Sanitation rubric, and the item goes home via DropRespawn as a fresh replacement so the experiment stays completable.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, DropRespawn respawn, Rigidbody rb, string label)
void Break()
```

### `BurnerController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/BurnerController.cs`</sub>

An ignitable Bunsen/alcohol burner (W5.8: matches finally DO something). Bring a lit matchstick to the burner and it lights — a looping flame + point light; Heat stations whose required prop is a burner only advance their sim while it is LIT (ZoneSimStation ignition gate).

```csharp
const float MatchIgniteDistance
bool IsLit
static bool ShouldIgnite(bool burnerLit, bool matchLit, float distance)
static bool ShouldBlowOut(bool lit, bool held)
void Ignite()
void Extinguish()
```

### `CenterTableMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/CenterTableMath.cs`</sub>

Pure geometry for the center-table merge (user 2026-07-10: remove the second island, one wide LANDSCAPE table centered in the lab). The experiment layouts bake world positions on the old left island, so the merge is a rigid remap — rotate 90° about the old island centre, translate to the new centre — applied identically to the island object AND every baked position on it, keeping every station/prop exactly where it sat on the deck.

```csharp
static Bounds FootprintOf(IEnumerable<Vector3> positions, float margin)
static Vector3 Remap(Vector3 p, Vector3 oldCenter, Vector3 newCenter, bool rotate90)
static Quaternion RemapRotation(Quaternion q, bool rotate90)
static bool WithinXZ(Vector3 p, Bounds b, float pad
static Vector3 MirrorAcrossX(Vector3 p, float centerX)
```

### `CleanupMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/CleanableVessel.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for glassware cleanliness (W5.12, user: "we scrub a test tube… a text appears that reduces the dirtiness for each swipe… after which the test tube is labeled clean"). Educational only — never graded.

```csharp
const float DirtyOnEmpty
const float SwipeDistance
const float DirtPerSwipe
const float RinsePerMl
static bool BecomesDirty(float previousMl, bool nowEmpty)
static float AfterSwipe(float dirtiness)
static float AfterRinse(float dirtiness, float mlAdded)
static string NamePrefix(float dirtiness, bool everDirty)
```

### `CleanableVessel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/CleanableVessel.cs`</sub>

Residue state on a vessel: emptying it after use makes it DIRTY (label prefix via VesselStatus); the test-tube brush scrubs it clean swipe by swipe, and wash-bottle water rinses it. Added by the kits builder and the stage builder next to LiquidPhysics.

```csharp
float Dirtiness
bool EverDirty
void Bind(LiquidPhysics lp)
float Scrub()
string NamePrefix()
```

### `BrushController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/CleanableVessel.cs`</sub>

The test-tube brush: while held and touching a dirty vessel, its travel accumulates — every SwipeDistance of scrubbing motion knocks one swipe off the dirtiness (the user's "repeated brushing" feel).

```csharp
void Bind(XRGrab grab)
```

### `DispenserMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ConsumableDispenser.cs`</sub>

Pure dispenser rules (user 2026-07-11: "put the box on the shelf; grabbing it pulls out a single piece to use"). Kept plain-C# so the self-tests pin the policy without a headset.

```csharp
static bool IsTaken(bool grabbed, float distFromRest, float takenDistance
static bool ShouldDiscard(bool everHeld, bool held, float speed, float idleSeconds,
```

### `ConsumableDispenser` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ConsumableDispenser.cs`</sub>

Turns a consumable box into an endless single-piece dispenser. The box stays fixed on the shelf; one ready piece rests in it. When a hand takes that piece, a fresh one appears after a short delay — so there's always exactly `readyCount` pieces to grab. Taken pieces get a DispensedConsumable that cleans them up once abandoned. Clones a hidden, fully-wired TEMPLATE so all the per-consumable wiring lives in the editor builder, not here.

```csharp
void Bind(GameObject template, Transform restAnchor, Transform spawnParent, GameObject seed, int readyCount)
```

### `DispensedConsumable` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ConsumableDispenser.cs`</sub>

A single piece that came out of a dispenser: once it's been picked up and then set down and left alone (or falls out of the world), it removes itself so used consumables don't accumulate. The dispenser handles refills; this handles the far end of the piece's life.

### `DevExperimentDriver` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DevExperimentDriver.cs`</sub>

Keyboard driver for in-editor testing of the experiment loop without needing full XR interaction. Lets you watch the HUD, Pharmee, and grade screen react. B = begin/restart · 1-5 = complete step N · F = finish · R = retry P = pour-debug overlay (floating "hit/target" text at every pouring mouth) V = replay Pharmee's test voice line (tune RobotVoiceFx by ear without walking back to the door for every slider tweak — 2026-07-27) Disabled in builds unless enableInBuild is set.

```csharp
void Setup(ExperimentRunner r, ExperimentStarter s)
```

### `DoorOpener` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DoorOpener.cs`</sub>

Swings a hinged door leaf open/closed and toggles its colliders — the lab entrance the PharmeeGatekeeper controls. Runtime animates the swing; edit mode snaps instantly (headless-testable).

```csharp
bool IsOpen
Transform Door
void SetDoor(Transform d, float yaw)
void SetOpen(bool open)
```

### `DropRespawnMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DropRespawn.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for when a loose prop goes back to its shelf spot (§2: kill-Z + idle return-to-home). Separated from the MonoBehaviour so the self-tests can pin the policy.

```csharp
static bool ShouldRespawn(float y, float killZ)
const float FloorY
static bool ShouldReturnHome(float distanceFromHome, float speed, bool held, float idleSeconds,
static bool ShouldSettleFreeze(bool held, bool kinematic, float speed, float settledSeconds,
```

### `DropRespawn` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DropRespawn.cs`</sub>

Sends a dropped prop home: below kill-Z → instant respawn; resting far from home and untouched for ~25 s → quiet return. Restores the shelf policy (kinematic) on arrival so the shelf stays tidy. Home is captured via SetHome() by the spawner (Awake doesn't fire on edit-mode AddComponent).

```csharp
void Bind(Rigidbody rb, XRGrab grab)
void SetHome(Vector3 pos, Quaternion rot)
bool Suspended
void SetKillZ(float y)
void CaptureSupply()
static void ResetAllHome()
void GoHome()
```

### `DropperMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DropperController.cs`</sub>

The contract that makes this work: **the number in the manuscript instruction IS the squeeze count, whatever its unit.** Manuscript Exp 2 measures in three units — "5 drops of Ferric Chloride", "2 ml of Tollen's reagent", "0.1 g of salicylic acid" — and the first two both become countable squeezes: "5 drops" -> 5 squeezes   (1 squeeze = 1 drop; physically honest) "2 ml"    -> 2 squeezes   (1 squeeze = 1 ml; the deliberate abstraction) Bulk volumes (the 10 ml of water) stay on the tilt-pour with its tolerance band; grams go to the spatula (ScoopMath). The watch panel prints the real quantity for learning and the squeeze count underneath it. Each squeeze deposits MlPerSqueeze into the target vessel through the normal AddLiquid path, so an existing LiquidTaskBinding.requiredMl does the counting for free ("5 drops" = requiredMl 5) — no new task plumbing, and a miscount is an unambiguous grad

```csharp
const float MlPerSqueeze
const float Capacity
static bool CanFill(float loadedMl, PhysicalState state, float availableMl,
static float FillCharge(float availableMl, float capacity
static bool CanSqueeze(float loadedMl, bool overTarget, bool sameAsSource)
static bool CanWaste(float loadedMl, bool overTarget)
static string HoldingLabel(string chem, float loadedMl)
static float SqueezeCharge(float loadedMl, float perSqueeze
static int SqueezesLeft(float loadedMl, float perSqueeze
static string SqueezeLabel(string chem, int dropsSoFar)
static string FillLabel(string chem, float chargeMl)
static float DrainScaleY(float authoredScaleY, float frac01)
static float DrainShift(float meshHalfY, float authoredScaleY, float currentScaleY)
```

### `DropperController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DropperController.cs`</sub>

Dropper/pipette verb: touch a liquid reagent's bottle to draw a charge, hold the dropper over a vessel and ACTIVATE (trigger) to release exactly one drop. Deliberately discrete — the squeeze count IS the measurement, so it must be a press, not a proximity brush like the scoop's dip. Self-contained like ScoopController: no scene authoring beyond the component (the probe works off renderer bounds; only a HELD dropper transfers, so shelf contact never draws). A hand-placed "DropperTip" child wins for the probe — same convention as the scoop's ScoopAnchor and the pestle's PestleTip, and the same latent bug it avoids (tracking the transform ORIGIN instead of the working end is what made the grind silently never complete).

```csharp
bool Loaded
int SqueezesLeft
void Bind(XRGrab grab)
```

### `FlameMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DryDistill.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for NAKED-FLAME heating (Exp 6's dry distillation — the ONE step in any experiment that heats over an open flame; everything else is a ≤100 °C water bath). A vessel held over a LIT burner climbs toward a red-glow temperature the bath can never reach.

```csharp
const float Reach
const float MaxC
const float RatePerSecond
static bool Heats(float distance)
static float NextTemp(float current, float dt)
```

### `NakedFlameHeat` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DryDistill.cs`</sub>

Zone-free open-flame heat on every Bunsen burner (wired by Apply W5.8): while LIT, any vessel within reach of the flame anchor heats toward 400 °C. This is what the hard-glass tubes exist for — the water bath owns every gentler step.

```csharp
void Bind(BurnerController burner)
void HeatVessel(LiquidPhysics vessel, float dt)
```

### `VaporMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DryDistill.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for VAPOR COLLECTION (Exp 6: distill the acetone off the glowing acetates at 56 °C into a receiver tube).

```csharp
const float DeliveryRadius
const float MlPerTick
static bool Fires(float sourceTempC, float requiredC, float sourceMl)
```

### `VaporCollectController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DryDistill.cs`</sub>

The dry-distillation product stream, zone-free (the fermentation pattern): once the collect task is AVAILABLE and the source tube is at temperature, it converts its charge into the module's product, condensing into the nearest nearby vessel whose binding EXPECTS the product — targeted, so the stream can never pollute the water bath or a bystander tube.

```csharp
string VaporTaskId
LiquidPhysics Source
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, LiquidPhysics source, string taskId,
void Detach()
bool EmitTick(LiquidPhysics receiver)
```

### `VesselWeighTask` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/DryDistill.cs`</sub>

Completes a WEIGH step ZONE-FREE on the bench balance (Exp 6's "weigh 7 g of each acetate"): the task is done when the vessel has been served its solids AND is resting SETTLED on the balance pan — the balance narrates the grams live the whole time.

```csharp
string TaskId
static bool ShouldComplete(bool allReagentsIn, bool settledOnPan)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, LiquidPhysics lp, LiquidTaskBinding binding)
void Detach()
```

### `EffectVfx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/EffectVfx.cs`</sub>

One-shot procedural particle bursts (VFX-set completion, user 2026-07-10), the event twin of StationVfx's looping station effects. All built at runtime from a shared soft-dot material (no asset deps, Quest-cheap, auto-destroy): • Shatter  — glass breaks into a quick outward spray of pale shards (fired from BreakableGlassware.Break, pairs with the glass-break SFX). • Confetti — a colourful upward burst on a passing grade (GradeScreen). • FlamePop — a brief orange flame puff (burner ignite / methane splint test). Each spawner returns immediately; the emitter fades and self-destroys.

### `Kind` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/EffectVfx.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static void Shatter(Vector3 pos, Color tint)
static void Shatter(Vector3 pos)
static void Confetti(Vector3 pos)
static void FlamePop(Vector3 pos)
static void ColdAir(Vector3 pos)
static void Smoke(Vector3 pos)
static void Smoke(Vector3 pos, Color tint)
static void FireBurst(Vector3 pos)
static void Spatter(Vector3 pos, Color tint)
static void ColorFlash(Vector3 pos, Color tint)
static Material ParticleMaterial()
static void Play(Kind kind, Vector3 pos, Color tint)
static Material SmokeMaterial()
```

### `EquipmentLabelVisibilityController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/EquipmentLabelVisibilityController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void SetLabelsVisible(bool visible)
```

### `LaunchMode` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLauncher.cs`</sub>

How Launch() leaves the runner: FullStart    — legacy behavior: stage built AND the clock starts immediately. PrepareArmed — stage built + attempt armed; the clock waits for StartRun() (door gate: "the period starts as soon as you walk in"). StageOnly    — stage furnished, runner untouched (scene-load default + Lab Tour).

### `ExperimentLauncher` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLauncher.cs`</sub>

Loads any of the 9 experiments into the lab scene by moduleId: it swaps the ExperimentRunner's active module (from the ExperimentLibrary) and readies an attempt per LaunchMode. The menu / period hub / door gate call Launch(); on lab-scene entry it can auto-launch whatever GameFlow.SelectedModuleId holds.

```csharp
UnityEvent<ExperimentModuleDefinition> onModuleLoaded
ExperimentLibrary Library
LaunchMode StartupMode
void SetLibrary(ExperimentLibrary l)
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void SetStartupMode(LaunchMode m)
ExperimentModuleDefinition LaunchSelected()
ExperimentModuleDefinition Launch(string moduleId)
ExperimentModuleDefinition Launch(string moduleId, LaunchMode mode)
```

### `StationSim` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLayout.cs`</sub>

Data description of one experiment's physical setup: where its stations, grabbable props and reagent vessels go. The ExperimentSceneBuilder spawns this on module load, so all 9 experiments share one lab scene instead of 9 hand-built scenes. Positions are WORLD-space (the lab is a fixed room). How a station completes. None = the prop simply entering the zone completes the step. Heat/Crystallise/Filter/Collect run a sustained chemistry sim while the prop occupies the zone. Stir/Grind/Weigh (W5.8, append-only — serialized ints stay valid) are TOOL verbs: circle the rod in the vessel, work the pestle in the mortar, rest the right load on the balance pan.

### `ExperimentLayout` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLayout.cs`</sub>

### `Station` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLayout.cs`</sub>

### `Prop` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLayout.cs`</sub>

### `Vessel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentLayout.cs`</sub>

```csharp
string moduleId
List<Station> stations
List<Prop> props
List<Vessel> vessels
```

### `ExperimentSceneBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentSceneBuilder.cs`</sub>

Spawns an experiment's physical setup (stations, grabbable props, reagent vessels) from its ExperimentLayout when a module loads — so all 9 experiments live in one lab scene. The hand-built Methane objects stay as a grouped stage that is simply toggled; every other experiment is built into a DynamicStage that is cleared and rebuilt on each module change.

```csharp
void SetRefs(ExperimentRunner r, SceneAssetLibrary a, ReactionRegistry reg, List<ExperimentLayout> ls)
ExperimentLayout FindLayout(string moduleId)
void OnModuleLoaded(ExperimentModuleDefinition m)
int Build(string moduleId)
```

### `ExperimentStarter` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentStarter.cs`</sub>

Kicks off (or restarts) an experiment — hook to the intro-cutscene "Start" button or a begin trigger (poke/grab an XR interactable on this object). Also serves the grade screen's Retry.

```csharp
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void Begin()
void Retry()
```

### `ExperimentTaskStation` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ExperimentTaskStation.cs`</sub>

A world location where a procedure step is performed. Completing the station (via interaction, trigger, or Activate()) advances the bound task in the runner. Prerequisite order is enforced by the runner (out-of-order → WrongStep mistake).

```csharp
string TaskId
string RequiredItemId
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void SetTaskId(string id)
void SetRequiredItemId(string id)
void Configure(ExperimentRunner r, string task, string itemId, bool triggerEnter, bool onSelect)
TaskCompletionResult Activate()
bool AcceptsItem(LabItem item)
```

### `FermentationMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FermentationController.cs`</sub>

The zone-free fermentation → CO₂ → limewater mechanic (Exp 3's signature, manuscript §A f–i). Once the must is prepared, the flask evolves CO₂; a delivery tube leads it into a limewater test tube, which turns milky (CaCO₃) — the proof fermentation is underway. Mirrors WaterBathController: no station, no zone — the flask emits to whatever limewater vessel the player brings near it, wherever in the lab. The task is authored longProcess=true, so completing it fades the screen black and returns "one week later" (TimeSkipController) — the manuscript's week of standing, compressed.

```csharp
const float DeliveryRadius
static bool IsFermenting(bool mustPrepared, float flaskMl)
static bool CO2Confirmed(float limewaterPptMl)
const float NudgeAfterSeconds
static bool ShouldNudge(bool fermenting, bool confirmed, float secondsFermenting, bool alreadyNudged)
```

### `FermentationController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FermentationController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
bool Fermenting
string FermentTaskId
ChemicalData Limewater
bool BubbleInto(LiquidPhysics tube)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, LiquidPhysics flaskLp, string fermentTask,
void Detach()
float DeliveryRadius
void EmitCO2()
```

### `FlameTestMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FlameTest.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for the FLAME (non-)flammability confirmation (Exp 7: "Try to ignite the chloroform. Light a match and place the flame near the vapors. Observe." — the NEGATIVE is the observation). Zone-free per the client rule: any lit flame brought to the served sample, anywhere in the lab.

```csharp
const float Reach
static bool Confirms(bool served, bool flameLit, float distance)
static Vector3 FlamePos(Component burner)
```

### `VesselFlameTask` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FlameTest.cs`</sub>

Completes a flammability-test step ZONE-FREE: once the sample vessel is served, holding any LIT match or burner flame to it confirms the result ("does not ignite") and completes the task. Wired by the scene builder from ExperimentLayout.Vessel.flameTaskId.

```csharp
string TaskId
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, LiquidTaskBinding binding, LiquidPhysics lp)
void Detach()
bool PollFlames()
```

### `FloatingText` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FloatingText.cs`</sub>

One-shot rising/fading world-space text (W5.8 feedback layer) — the "what did my mix produce" popup, "Vessel full!", stir progress, etc. EffectVfx style: static entry point, procedural, self-destroying, runtime-only.

```csharp
static void Show(string text, Vector3 pos, Color? color
```

### `FloatingTextFx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FloatingText.cs`</sub>

Rise + fade driver for FloatingText (component so it survives the frame).

```csharp
void Bind(TextMeshPro tmp)
```

### `StrideMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FootstepPlayer.cs`</sub>

Pure stride accumulator so the step cadence is unit-testable.

```csharp
static int Steps(ref float accumulator, float distance, float strideMeters)
```

### `FootstepPlayer` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/FootstepPlayer.cs`</sub>

Plays a footstep per stride of horizontal locomotion (§4 action SFX). Tracks the HEAD, not the rig root — the XR Device Simulator's WASD (and real-world walking) move the HMD without moving the origin, so tracking the origin missed them entirely. Teleports/fades are ignored via a snap guard.

### `GrabPhysicsPolicy` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/GrabPhysicsPolicy.cs`</sub>

Kinematic-on-shelf / dynamic-on-release policy (task #78). Props spawn kinematic so shelves stay tidy and the rigidbody budget stays cheap; the first time the player releases one, it goes dynamic so it falls and settles instead of freezing mid-air (XRGrabInteractable restores the grab-time kinematic state on release, which would leave items floating — this runs after that restore and overrides it).

```csharp
void Bind(Rigidbody rb, XRGrab grab)
void OnReleased()
bool IsDynamic
```

### `GrabTuning` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/GrabTuning.cs`</sub>

through walls/floor/furniture). The ChemLab pack prefabs shipped with movementType = Instantaneous, which teleports the transform to the hand each frame — no physics sweep, so a held beaker passes straight through static geometry. VelocityTracking drives the rigidbody with velocities instead, so PhysX resolves collisions and a held item stops against the world. Two-handed grab (user 2026-07-11: "hold a container in one hand and pour with the other; steady the mortar and grind with the pestle — for everything"). selectMode = Multiple lets two interactors select the SAME item at once; XRI's default General grab transformer blends the two-handed pose (midpoint position, hand-to-hand rotation). Single-hand use is unchanged — it just also permits a second hand. Independent dual-hand use (one object per hand) already works. One seam applied everywhere: prefabs + scene instances (Wire Grab Coll

```csharp
const float AttachEaseSeconds
static bool IsTuned(XRGrab grab)
static bool Apply(XRGrab grab)
```

### `GrindController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/GrindController.cs`</sub>

The GRIND verb (W5.8): work the pestle in circles inside this mortar's bowl and the grind task completes (dual-path on Methane: the legacy zone-touch still works). When done, a powder heap appears in the bowl. A null/empty taskId makes it purely educational — staged mortars still grind visually.

```csharp
OrbitMath Math
bool IsGrindComplete()
static bool CanGrind(bool hasVessel, float contentsMl)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, Transform pestle,
void SetPestle(Transform pestle)
void BindRunner(ExperimentRunner runner)
void SetTaskId(string taskId)
string TaskId
void Register()
bool PestleInBowl()
void Tick(float x, float z, bool inside)
```

### `HandPoseKind` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HandPoseController.cs`</sub>

The hand's three display poses (user 2026-07-11): FREE (open), GRAB (holding something), POINT (index extended while the ray hovers an interactable — Pharmee, tools, reagents, buttons).

### `HandPosePolicy` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HandPoseController.cs`</sub>

Pure hand display policy (edit-mode testable).

```csharp
static HandPoseKind PoseFor(bool selecting, bool hovering)
static bool Nitrile(bool glovesWorn)
const float ProximalCurl
const float IntermediateCurl
const float DistalCurl
const float ThumbProximalCurl
const float ThumbDistalCurl
const float PoseDegreesPerSecond
static float AngleFor(HandPoseKind pose, bool isThumb, bool isIndex, int segment)
```

### `HandPoseController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HandPoseController.cs`</sub>

Runtime driver on each controller: shows the skinned hand (XR Hands sample mesh), keeps the default controller model hidden, poses the fingers (Free / Grab while selecting / Point while hovering an interactable), and swaps the material bare<->nitrile from the PPE gloves state. Wired by Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Hand Visuals.

### `Joint` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HandPoseController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void Bind(Transform hand, GameObject ctrlVisual, SkinnedMeshRenderer smr,
void SetPoseImmediate(HandPoseKind pose)
```

### `HandSwap` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HandVisualKeeper.cs`</sub>

Pure hand-vs-glove display policy (edit-mode testable). The bare white hand shows whenever the first-person PPE glove is NOT worn; donning gloves swaps the glove in (never both at once).

```csharp
static bool ShowBareHand(bool gloveVisible)
```

### `HandVisualKeeper` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HandVisualKeeper.cs`</sub>

Runtime keeper on each controller (user 2026-07-11: "no hands, just controllers / hands on top of the controllers"). Every frame it: - hides the default XRI controller MODEL (the hand replaces it), - keeps the bare hand visible (other systems were toggling it off), - swaps bare hand ↔ FPGlove when PPE gloves are donned/removed. Wired by Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Hand Visuals.

```csharp
void Bind(GameObject hand, GameObject controllerModel, GameObject glove)
```

### `HeadPushbackMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HeadCollisionPushback.cs`</sub>

Pure pushback resolution (edit-mode testable). Both rules exist because the old inline version broke headset play (2026-08-24: player ended up under the lab floor, unable to walk).

```csharp
const float SurfaceSkin
static bool IsBlockingHit(float hitDistance)
static Vector3 Correction(Vector3 lastValid, Vector3 target, Vector3 dir, float nearest)
```

### `HeadCollisionPushback` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HeadCollisionPushback.cs`</sub>

Stops the player's HEAD from phasing through static geometry, no matter how the camera moved — thumbstick locomotion, the XR Device Simulator's direct HMD translate (which bypasses the CharacterController by design), or physically leaning through a wall. Each frame the head's path is swept as a small sphere; if it would cross static geometry, the whole rig is pulled back so the head stays on the outside. Triggers, the rig's own colliders, and dynamic props (anything with a Rigidbody) never push back.

```csharp
void Bind(Transform headT, Transform rigT)
```

### `HoverHighlight` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HoverHighlight.cs`</sub>

Grabbable affordance (user 2026-07-10: prop readability): when a hand/ray hovers a real-scale lab tool, it brightens (base-colour tint via a MaterialPropertyBlock — no per-material keyword or shader needed) and pops slightly larger, so small items are easy to spot and grab; it restores on hover-exit and while actually held. Thin MB over a pure scale helper.

```csharp
bool IsHighlighted
bool IsGuided
void Bind(XRGrab grab)
static Vector3 HighlightScale(Vector3 baseScale, bool on, float factor)
void SetHighlight(bool on)
void SetGuide(bool on, TargetRole role)
void SetDimmed(bool on)
bool IsDimmed
```

### `HoverInspector` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/HoverInspector.cs`</sub>

Points-at-it inspector (user 2026-07-10): each frame it casts from the pointer (right-hand ray, falling back to gaze) and, if it lands on a known reagent bottle, a piece of apparatus or an NPC, shows a smooth info card (HoverInfoPanel) naming it and explaining what it is / how to use it. A short linger stops the card from flickering as the ray grazes edges. Resolution is data-driven (LabInfoDatabase), so no per-object authoring is needed.

```csharp
void Bind(Transform aim, Transform headT, HoverInfoPanel p, LayerMask m)
static LabInfoEntry ResolveFor(Collider col, out Vector3 anchor)
static LabInfoEntry WithLiveLine(LabInfoEntry e, LiquidPhysics lp)
static bool IsHeld(Collider col)
```

### `IceBathMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/IceBathController.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for the ZONE-FREE ice bath (Exp 4 crystallisation, Exp 8's ice bath) — the cold twin of WaterBathMath. The bucket needs nothing lit or poured: it IS ice. Set any vessel in (or beside) it, anywhere in the lab, and the vessel takes ice-water temperature.

```csharp
const float VesselRadius
const float IceWaterC
static bool Chills(float distance)
static string StatusLine()
```

### `IceBathController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/IceBathController.cs`</sub>

The bucket itself: every LiquidPhysics vessel brought close is pulled to ice-water temperature. No station, no pad — carry the bucket or carry the flask, either way works (the zone-free tool rule, user 2026-07-17).

```csharp
Vector3 ChillZoneCenter
float ChillZoneRadius
void Bind(ProximityLabel label)
void ChillVessel(LiquidPhysics vessel)
```

### `VesselChillTask` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/IceBathController.cs`</sub>

Completes a chill step ZONE-FREE: the task is done when this vessel actually HOLDS something and has been brought down to the required temperature — however and wherever the player cooled it. The cold twin of VesselHeatTask (Exp 4's "cool in an ice bath; crystallise"). Ambient is 25 °C, so a vessel can never satisfy a chill threshold by simply standing on the bench.

```csharp
string TaskId
float RequiredC
bool Relevant
static bool ShouldComplete(bool allReagentsIn, bool hasContents, float tempC, float requiredC)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, float requiredC, LiquidPhysics lp,
void Detach()
```

### `ImpactSound` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ImpactSound.cs`</sub>

Material-aware drop clatter (§4 action SFX): a FREE (dynamic) item landing plays its material's clip — glass clinks, metal clatters, wood knocks. Impacts at glass-breaking speed stay silent here; BreakableGlassware plays the shatter instead. (No RequireComponent: colliders often live on children; collision events still route to the Rigidbody host.)

```csharp
void Bind(Rigidbody rb, string soundKey, float breakSpeedCeiling
```

### `LabHaptics` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/LabHaptics.cs`</sub>

Semantic haptics: the hands should be able to tell RIGHT from WRONG without looking. The VR affordance pass already gives every interactor a generic grab/poke buzz, so picking up the correct bottle and picking up the wrong one felt exactly the same — and in VR the score bar and the toast are both easy to miss while you are looking at your hands. These two cues ride alongside the audio that already fires for the same events, so there is one place per event rather than a parallel system. Deliberately two DISTINCT shapes rather than a rhythm: a short crisp tick for progress and a long coarse buzz for a mistake are told apart instantly, and neither needs a coroutine to play a second beat.

```csharp
const float StepAmplitude
const float ErrorAmplitude
static void Pulse(float amplitude, float seconds)
static void StepComplete()
static void Mistake()
static void Forget()
```

### `LabItem` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/LabItem.cs`</sub>

Identity carried by a grabbable lab prop (reagent jar, glass tube, lit splint, collection tube, burner…). An ExperimentTaskStation can require a specific itemId so that bringing the *right* prop to the *right* apparatus — not just any grabbed object — completes that step. This turns the abstract poke-stations into hands-on "gather the correct item and place it" interactions (plan §3.2, W5).

```csharp
string itemId
string displayName
void SetItemId(string id)
static LabItem Resolve(Collider other)
```

### `LayoutTidyMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/LayoutTidyMath.cs`</sub>

Pure zoning grid for the center-table layout pass (W5.8: "place all the equipment properly — facing, spacing, open space"). The wide landscape deck (y 0.91, x −1.85…1.40, z −3.94…−2.74; the player works the +z front edge) is divided into four zones; every layout's items are re-seated onto the deterministic slots below, in authored order: • STATIONS  — ONE back row, 0.5 m pitch (verbs need elbow room; the busiest module has 7 stations — exactly one full row) • VESSELS   — center-front, where both hands can reach • REAGENTS  — right-side grid (pourable bottles), 4 per column • TOOLS     — left-side grid (rods, tongs, dishes…), 3 per column The front strip z > −2.90 stays free for the builder's rack, spares and match kits. Suite-pinned; the LayoutTidy menu writes these into the SOs.

```csharp
const float DeckY
const float MinX
const float MinZ
const float MinPairDistance
const float MinStationDistance
const int StationsPerRow
static Vector3 StationPos(int i)
static Vector3 VesselPos(int i)
static Vector3 ReagentPos(int i)

static Vector3 SparePos(int i)
static Vector3 MatchPos(int i)
static Vector3 StrikerPos
```

### `LitmusMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/LitmusStrip.cs`</sub>

Pure litmus colour response (manuscript: pH checks in Exp 3, 4, 8).

```csharp
static readonly Color AcidRed
static readonly Color NeutralViolet
static readonly Color BaseBlue
const float AcidPH
const float BasePH
static Color ColorForPH(float pH)
static float DominantPH(float a, float b)
```

### `LitmusStrip` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/LitmusStrip.cs`</sub>

A grabbable litmus strip: touch it to any liquid (trigger or collision with a vessel holding a chemical) and it tints to the mixture's pH — one-shot, like the real thing. Built by the cabinet builder's consumables box.

```csharp
bool Used
void Bind(Renderer r)
void TouchVessel(LiquidPhysics lp)
void Apply(float pH)
```

### `VesselLitmusTask` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/LitmusStrip.cs`</sub>

Completes a litmus-confirmation step ZONE-FREE (Exp 4's "blue litmus turns red"; Exp 8's "red litmus turns blue"): the task is done when this vessel has been served its reagents AND a litmus strip actually touched it while the mixture read a DEFINITIVE pH — red on acid, blue on base — wherever the player does it. A neutral read (water first, nothing dissolved yet) marks nothing; touch again with a fresh strip once the product is in.

```csharp
string TaskId
static bool ShouldComplete(bool allReagentsIn, bool stripReadDefinitive)
void NotifyRead(float pH)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, LiquidTaskBinding binding, LiquidPhysics lp)
void Detach()
```

### `MatchStrikerSurface` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/MatchStrikerSurface.cs`</sub>

Marker: swiping a held matchstick across this surface lights it (W5.8 — "matches must work"). Lives on the matches dispenser box and burner bases.

### `Matchstick` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/Matchstick.cs`</sub>

A grabbable matchstick (manuscript: combustion/flammability tests, Exp 3/4/7 + the methane splint). Two ways to light it (W5.8): STRIKE it — swipe the held match across a striker surface (the matches box, a burner base) — or hold its head near anything already hot. A lit match then ignites burners (BurnerController) and fires the methane splint test. Pure predicates for the suite.

```csharp
const float IgniteDistance
const float IgniteTempC
const float StrikeMinSpeed
bool IsLit
bool IsSpent
static bool ShouldIgnite(float distance, float tempC, bool alreadyLit, bool spent)
static bool ShouldStrike(bool held, bool lit, bool spent, float relSpeed, bool strikerSurface, float minSpeed
void Ignite()
void Extinguish(bool spent)
static Vector3 LongestLocalAxis(Transform t, Bounds b, out float halfExtent)
```

### `MethaneApparatusRig` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/MethaneApparatusRig.cs`</sub>

Methane (Experiment 1) completion — LOCATION-FREE (user 2026-07-13: "we can perform anywhere in the lab as long as we complete the steps"). The old rig gated heat/collect on FIXED trigger zones; this instead detects the ACTIONS by item proximity, so the tutorial works wherever the player does it: prepare-mixture : grinding a mortar (the rig aims the workspace mortar at it) setup-apparatus : the collection tube brought up to the hard-glass tube heat-mixture    : a LIT burner held near the hard-glass tube (it heats) collect-gas     : the hot tube + collection tube held together (gas fills) test-gas        : a LIT match brought to the FILLED collection tube (pop) The rig owns its own TemperatureSim + GasCollection (no station objects). Items are found at runtime by LabItem.itemId, so the player can use their own workspace burner/tube/mortar anywhere.

```csharp
const float SplintMatchDistance
const float SplintAutoSeconds
static bool WithinReach(float distance, float reach)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, TemperatureSim t, GasCollection g)
void HandleExperimentStarted(ExperimentModuleDefinition module)
void RegisterTutorialTargets()
void Step(float dt)
static float GlowFor(float currentC, float targetC)
```

### `MethaneStageVisibility` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/MethaneStageVisibility.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the hand-built Methane stage should be PRESENT only during the Lab Tour and the Methane tutorial itself, and gone the moment you move on to any other experiment or are idle in the lab. Methane is the only experiment that uses this stage (Experiment 1), so a single controller owns its visibility — the sole authority (ExperimentSceneBuilder no longer toggles it). Lives on a manager object, NOT on the stage (it must keep running while the stage is hidden). Edit mode leaves the stage as-authored so it can be relocated by hand; this only governs Play. The user hand-moved the 5 methane PROPS out of the stage hierarchy onto the workspace, so toggling the stage alone would leave them visible ("leaking"). This also gathers those loose props by their methane itemIds and toggles them alongside the stage — no reparenting, so the hand placement is untouched.

```csharp
const string MethaneModuleId
static bool ShouldShow(bool tourActive, bool methaneAttemptActive)
void Bind(GameObject stage, ExperimentRunner runner, LabTourGuide tour)
```

### `MirrorPlane` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/MirrorPlane.cs`</sub>

Real-time dressing mirror (user 2026-07-10) using the canonical planar reflection-matrix technique. Each frame a child camera is placed at the player's eye REFLECTED across the mirror plane and renders the scene with an oblique near plane clamped to the glass (so the wall the mirror hangs on never occludes the view). Rendered by hand — URP does NOT auto-render an enabled off-screen camera, which left the render texture black (user report 2026-07-10) — with inverted culling so the handedness-flipped reflected geometry keeps facing the right way. Distance-gated for the Quest budget. Note: a mirror can only reflect geometry that exists. The player sees the surroundings; seeing THEMSELVES additionally needs a visible body/PPE avatar (tracked separately in the work checklist).

```csharp
static bool ShouldRender(float distance, float activeDistance, float facingDot, float viewDot)
```

### `Mishandling` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/Mishandling.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for mishandling penalties (§2: spill & breakage, user request 2026-07-09): which apparatus is fragile, when an impact shatters it, and when an un-held bottle counts as spilling. Kept plain-C# so the self-tests pin the policy.

```csharp
static bool IsBreakable(string prefabName)
static IEnumerable<string> BreakableNames
const float DefaultBreakSpeed
static bool ShouldBreak(float impactSpeed, float breakSpeed
static string DropSoundKey(string prefabName)
static string SfxForOutcome(ReactionOutcome outcome)
static bool IsSpilling(float tiltDegrees, bool held, float liquidMl, float tiltThreshold
static float ImpactVolume01(float impactSpeed, float quietSpeed
static string DisplayNameFor(GameObject go)
static string Prettify(string codeName)
```

### `MixFeedback` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/MixFeedback.cs`</sub>

"What did my mix produce?" feedback on a vessel (W5.8): a registered reaction pops its authored observation text + a colour flash; a harmless no-rule mix reports the mixture story; an overflow says "Vessel full!" and wets the bench. Hazardous mixes stay SILENT here — HazardousMixReactor owns that consequence theatre (smoke/fire/alarm) and double-messaging would bury it. Feedback only: no new graded mistakes.

```csharp
static bool ShouldAnnounceWrongMix(HazardousMix.HazardOutcome outcome)
static bool ShouldShowObservation(bool sameRule, float now, float lastAt, float window
void Bind(LiquidPhysics lp)
```

### `OrbitMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/OrbitMath.cs`</sub>

Pure circular-motion accumulator shared by the STIR and GRIND verbs (W5.8): feed it the tool tip's XZ offset from the vessel/bowl axis each frame; while the tip stays inside the working radius the swept angle accumulates (direction-agnostic, per-sample clamped so teleports/jitter can't cheat). Leaving the zone PAUSES progress — it never resets (a student lifting the rod to check shouldn't lose their work).

```csharp
float requiredRevs
const float MaxDegPerSample
float Progress01
bool IsDone
float SweptDegrees
void Feed(float x, float z, bool inside)
void Reset()
```

### `RestPose` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/PhysicsProfiles.cs`</sub>

How an item plausibly rests on a bench when nothing holds it.

### `PhysicsProfile` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/PhysicsProfiles.cs`</sub>

```csharp
float massKg
RestPose pose
PhysicsProfile(float mass, RestPose p)
```

### `PhysicsProfiles` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/PhysicsProfiles.cs`</sub>

Physics-attribute table for the ChemLab prefabs — the companion to RealSizes (task #78 physics/resting-pose audit). Name → realistic mass + plausible resting pose, plus the pure math that turns a pose into a rotation and the guards the audit tool uses (degenerate colliders, resting plausibility). Policy: items spawn KINEMATIC on the shelf; GrabPhysicsPolicy flips them dynamic on first release so a dropped glass rod falls and lies on its side instead of freezing mid-air or balancing upright.

```csharp
static int Count
static IEnumerable<string> Names
static bool TryGet(string prefabName, out PhysicsProfile profile)
static Quaternion RestRotation(RestPose pose, Vector3 boundsSize)
static bool IsRestingPlausible(RestPose pose, Vector3 worldSize)
static bool IsDegenerate(Vector3 colliderWorldSize, float minDim
static Rigidbody EnsurePhysics(GameObject go, string prefabName)
static int ConvexifyMeshColliders(GameObject go)
static Collider EnsureCollider(GameObject go)
```

### `PlacementAnchor` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/PlacementAnchor.cs`</sub>

A tiny draggable marker the user positions in the editor to tell a verb exactly WHERE something happens on an imported mesh — the flame on a match head, the flame on a burner mouth, the bowl of a scoopula. Bounds-based guessing can't know a model's axis convention (user 2026-07-14: "can I drag these to the specific parts?"), so the code reads this anchor's position and falls back to a heuristic only when no anchor is present. Convention: a child named "FlameAnchor" (Matchstick / BurnerController) or "ScoopAnchor" (ScoopController). Drag it in the Scene view, then Lock My Layout to bake it. The gizmo just makes it easy to see/select.

```csharp
Color gizmoColor
float gizmoRadius
bool previewsScale
bool previewsTube
const float TubeHeight
const float TubeRadius
```

### `PlayerAvatarRig` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/PlayerAvatarRig.cs`</sub>

Drives the mirror-only first-person avatar (user 2026-07-10): stands the body at the player's feet, turns it to the head's yaw, and feeds the Animation-Rigging IK targets (head + both hands) from the HMD and controllers so the reflection moves with you. Attach to the avatar root; `PlayerAvatarBuilder` wires the transforms. The avatar renders on the PlayerAvatar layer, which the main camera culls and the mirror includes — so you see this only in the mirror.

```csharp
void Bind(Transform h, Transform l, Transform r,
void SetFootOffset(float offset)
static Vector3 FootUnder(Vector3 headPos, float floorY, float offsetY)
```

### `PlayerTriggerRelay` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/PlayerTriggerRelay.cs`</sub>

Fires an event when the PLAYER (any collider under the rig root) enters this trigger volume — used by the door-gate approach + threshold zones. Ignores props, NPCs and stray physics bodies.

```csharp
UnityEvent onPlayerEntered
void SetPlayerRoot(Transform t)
void SimulateEnter()
```

### `RackDispenserMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/RackDispenser.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for a capped tube rack (user 2026-07-12: "unmovable racks that when grabbed pull out single items, with a cap so the maximum is controlled"). Unlike the ConsumableDispenser (endless single-piece box for matches/litmus), a rack holds a FINITE set of REUSABLE tubes — one persistent instance per hole. Pulling one leaves its hole empty; the tube stays a normal grabbable (fillable, cleanable, breakable → returns home). The cap is the hole count by construction: you can never have more tubes out than the rack was built with.

```csharp
static bool InHole(bool held, float distFromHole, float slotRadius
static int OutCount(int capacity, int seated)
static string Label(string kind, int seated, int capacity)
```

### `RackDispenser` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/RackDispenser.cs`</sub>

A fixed rack that holds a capped pool of reusable tubes. The rack itself is inert furniture (no grab, kinematic); each hole owns one persistent tube whose DropRespawn home is that hole, so a tube pulled out is a free grabbable and an abandoned one finds its way back. Shows a live "seated/capacity" count. Built by WorkspaceKitsBuilder; nothing to author by hand.

```csharp
int Capacity
void Bind(Transform[] holes, GameObject[] tubes, ProximityLabel label, string kind)
int SeatedCount()
```

### `RealSizes` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/RealSizes.cs`</sub>

Real-world size table for the ChemLab prefabs: name → LONGEST dimension in metres. The pack's meshes are authored true-to-scale, so these pin each item to its realistic size and normalisation scales by the longest axis — the old bounds-HEIGHT normalisation inflated flat tools (spatula, iron ring, wire gauze) by 3-16x, which read as comically massive in-headset.

```csharp
static int Count
static IEnumerable<string> Names
static bool TryGet(string prefabName, out float longestMeters)
static float UniformScaleFactor(Vector3 currentWorldSize, float targetLongest)
```

### `ScoopMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ScoopController.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for scooping solids (W5.12, user: "some reagents are needed to be scooped… scoop adds a specific amount per scoop… the visual increases and so does the scale text"). Kept plain so the suite pins the policy.

```csharp
const float GramsPerScoop
const float GramsPerSpatula
static bool CanPickUp(bool carrying, PhysicalState state, float availableMl)
static float ScoopCharge(float availableMl, float perScoop
static bool CanDeposit(bool carrying, bool sameContainer)
static string DepositLabel(string chem, float addedG, float totalG)
```

### `ScoopController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ScoopController.cs`</sub>

Scoopula/spatula verb: dip into a solid reagent's jar to pick up a fixed charge (a visible tinted heap rides the blade), touch a receiving vessel to deposit it — per-scoop FloatingText totals, and the balance/VesselStatus update through the normal contents path. Self-contained: no scene authoring needed beyond adding the component (the proximity probe works off renderer bounds; only a HELD scoop transfers, so shelf contact never scoops).

```csharp
bool Carrying
void Bind(XRGrab grab)
void SetGramsPerDip(float grams)
float GramsPerDip
void SetHeapScale(Vector3 s)
Vector3 HeapScale
static float MoundFill(float grams, float fullAtG
```

### `HeightCalibration` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SeatedHeightBoost.cs`</sub>

Pure fixed-eye-height math (edit-mode testable). Design (user 2026-07-11): per-scene FIXED eye height, NOT relative to the player's real height — the Quest/Link runtime flip-flops between Floor and Device origin spaces across sessions, so any "relative" scheme produced floor-spawns or roof-spawns. Measure where the headset says the head is ONCE at load (only from a VALID, SETTLED pose), then offset the rig so the eye line lands exactly on the scene's authored height. Offset may be NEGATIVE (pulls a too-high pose back down). Gravity (move providers, m_UseGravity on) keeps the rig grounded.

```csharp
const float MaxAdjust
const float TallTolerance
static float FixedOffset(float targetEye, float trackedHeadY)
const float ShortTolerance
static float TallExcess(float eyeNow, float target)
static bool PoseValid(Vector3 headLocalPos, float lastY)
```

### `SeatedHeightBoost` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SeatedHeightBoost.cs`</sub>

Thin driver on the XR Origin (class name kept so existing scene wiring stays valid — behaviour is FIXED height, no seated boost / auto-levitate). v3 fixes (user 2026-07-11: "1.6x too tall in menu / roof in lab"): the old settle counter counted frames of UNTRACKED (0,0,0) poses during the load fade, measured y≈0, applied the max +1.5 offset, and the real head height then stacked on top (eye ≈ 2.5 m → too tall; capsule ballooned into the lab ceiling → depenetration shoved the rig onto the roof). Now: - calibration only accepts a valid, settled pose (see PoseValid); - the offset is held at 0 until calibrated (a stale Device-mode 1.36 can never balloon the capsule during load); - the roof-recovery guard runs CONTINUOUSLY, not once. Recalibrates only on scene load / explicit Recalibrate() — never mid-play. Per-scene targets set by Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Wire Spawn Height.

```csharp
float TargetEyeHeight
bool Calibrated
float AppliedOffset
void Bind(Transform cam, Transform offset)
void SetTarget(float eyeHeight)
void Recalibrate()
```

### `SelectSfx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SelectSfx.cs`</sub>

Plays a SoundBank key when this interactor selects something — used for the station snap sockets ("socket-snap" as the prop clicks into place).

```csharp
void Bind(XRInteractor interactor, string soundKey)
```

### `SimLoopAudio` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SimLoopAudio.cs`</sub>

Looping apparatus audio for a sim-driven station (§4): boil bubbles while heating, drips while filtering, hiss while collecting gas, shimmer while crystallising. Owns a positional AudioSource; ZoneSimStation drives SetRunning from zone occupancy. Safe with missing clips (silent no-op).

```csharp
static string KeyFor(StationSim kind)
void Bind(string soundKey)
bool IsPlaying
void SetRunning(bool on)
```

### `SpawnBurstFX` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SpawnBurstFX.cs`</sub>

Cyan "materialize" spawn burst (user 2026-07-10): a one-shot column of cyan particles that rises from the player's feet like smoke on every teleport / reset / spawn — the classic game spawn animation. Scene singleton (mirrors ScreenFader); triggers fire it null-safely via SpawnBurstFX.Instance?.PlayAtPlayer().

```csharp
static SpawnBurstFX Instance
void SetSystem(ParticleSystem ps)
void PlayAtPlayer()
void PlayAt(Vector3 feet)
```

### `SpillMistake` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SpillMistake.cs`</sub>

Grades reagent spills (§2 mishandling penalties). LiquidPourer already drains any bottle tipped past its pour threshold — this watches for that happening while NOBODY is holding the bottle (knocked over / dropped) and records one SpilledReagent mistake per episode, re-arming once the bottle is righted. The lost volume itself is the second penalty: it comes out of the finite supply, so a bad spill can starve a step into the existing restart-prompt path.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, LiquidPhysics liquid, XRGrab grab, string label)
static Color LiquidColorOf(LiquidPhysics liquid)
```

### `SpillPuddle` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/SpillPuddle.cs`</sub>

A liquid puddle left on the ground by a spilled/broken vessel (user 2026-07-10: "liquid spilled on ground … a 3 seconds delay then smoothly fades away"). Spawn() drops a flat translucent disc at the impact point (raycast to the floor), tinted with the spilled chemical's colour; it lingers, then fades out and destroys itself. Purely visual — the graded penalty + supply loss already happen in SpillMistake/LiquidPourer/BreakableGlassware.

```csharp
static float Alpha01(float age, float linger, float fade)
static SpillPuddle Spawn(Vector3 worldPos, Color liquidColor, float radius
```

### `StationSocketFilter` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/StationSocketFilter.cs`</sub>

Select filter for a station's snap socket (§2 sockets): the socket accepts only the station's required item, so the beaker clicks onto the heat pad but a random spatula bounces off. Empty requiredItemId = accept anything.

```csharp
string requiredItemId
bool canProcess
bool Process(IXRSelectInteractor interactor, IXRSelectInteractable interactable)
static bool Matches(string requiredId, LabItem item)
```

### `StationStatusLabel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/StationStatusLabel.cs`</sub>

Live status on a sim station's billboard label (W5.8: "the temperature showing in heaters etc"): Heat shows "62 C -> 150 C", Filter/Collect/ Crystallise show percent progress. Throttled + change-gated; formats live in VesselStatusMath so the suite pins them.

```csharp
void SetIgnitionHint(System.Func<bool> isLit)
void Bind(TMP_Text tmp, string baseLabel, StationSim kind,
void Refresh()
string ComposeStatus()
```

### `StationVfx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/StationVfx.cs`</sub>

Per-station particle effects (user 2026-07-10: "special effects for boiling, freezing etc."), the visual twin of SimLoopAudio: while the required prop occupies a sim station the effect plays — steam for Heat (boiling), a frosty sparkle for Crystallise (freezing/ice bath), a falling drip for Filter, rising bubbles for Collect. Attached + bound by ExperimentSceneBuilder per station; ZoneSimStation drives SetRunning from occupancy. The ParticleSystem is built procedurally on first use (no asset dependencies — Quest-cheap, ≤60 live).

```csharp
static string StyleFor(StationSim s)
bool IsPlaying
void Bind(StationSim kind)
void SetRunning(bool on)
```

### `StirController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/StirController.cs`</sub>

The STIR verb (W5.8): circle the glass rod inside this vessel's mouth while it holds liquid and the stir task completes — works with the vessel on the table OR held in a hand (everything is vessel-relative). Progress pops as floating text; the TaskGraph condition owns completion (Retry-safe via the ZoneSimStation resubscribe pattern).

```csharp
OrbitMath Math
string TaskId
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, LiquidPhysics lp, Transform rod,
void SetRod(Transform rod)
void Detach()
void Register()
bool RodInMouth()
void Tick(float x, float z, bool inside)
```

### `TVRepositionController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TVRepositionController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void ApplyReposition()
```

### `TabletGestureController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TabletGestureController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
UnityEvent onTabletGesture
```

### `TargetRole` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TaskTargetRegistry.cs`</sub>

What role an object plays in a step — drives the guidance tint and whether grabbing it should silence the glow.

### `TaskTarget` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TaskTargetRegistry.cs`</sub>

One highlightable object for one task.

```csharp
Transform transform
TargetRole role
bool stayLitWhenHeld
VerbKind verb
```

### `TaskTargetRegistry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TaskTargetRegistry.cs`</sub>

taskId → the scene objects that step involves. Formerly ExperimentStationRegistry, which mapped ONE Transform per task and was fed only by ExperimentTaskStation.OnEnable. Since the zone-free conversion (2026-07-17) no module stages a station, so nothing ever registered and every consumer silently got null — WaypointGuide has been calling Hide() every frame in all 9 modules ever since. Widened to a list and fed by the TutorialTargets sweep, which is the single source of truth: components no longer self-register, so there is no second lifetime to keep in sync.

```csharp
static void Register(string taskId, Transform t, TargetRole role, bool stayLitWhenHeld,
static IReadOnlyList<TaskTarget> Targets(string taskId)
static int TaskCount
static void Clear()
```

### `TutorialTargets` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TaskTargetRegistry.cs`</sub>

Builds the taskId → objects map by sweeping the live scene once per run. Deliberately DERIVED from the components that actually complete each task rather than from an authored per-task list. An authored list can drift from the binding it describes — exactly the bug class the W5.34 clueless-player audit was spent on (a hint whose ACTION line contradicted the binding it had to satisfy). Deriving makes that disagreement structurally impossible: if the sweep points at it, it is the thing that completes the step.

```csharp
static readonly List<string> LastUnresolved
static void Build()
static void AuditAgainst(IEnumerable<ExperimentTask> tasks)
```

### `TimeSkipController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TimeSkipController.cs`</sub>

Compresses a real-world wait the player can't sit through (user 2026-07-17: "after the mixture requirement is set, the screen fades black for 2 s, and when it returns a success text says the time has passed and it's done. Set this for all procedures across all experiments that need lengthy time"). A task authored longProcess=true fades the screen to black on completion, holds, then fades back in with a "time has passed" message. Zone-free and experiment-agnostic: it keys off the task flag, so any module's week-long fermentation / overnight dry / hour-long crystallisation reuses it for free.

```csharp
static bool IsTimeSkip(ExperimentTask t)
static string MessageFor(ExperimentTask t)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r)
static bool IsSkipping
```

### `TubeSlotMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TubeRackSlots.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for snapping a released test tube into a workspace holder slot (user 2026-07-16: "the racking of the tubes wont work for the Experiment_Tube_Table_Kit_Holder_1 to 4. It doesn't automatically get and rack the tubes, even empty ones that I place near it"). The green Slot_* anchors were only EDITOR ghosts until now — position markers the user dragged into the holder's holes. This gives them their runtime half: release any tube (regular or hard-glass — both carry itemId kit-testtube) near a free slot and it seats upright in the hole.

```csharp
const float SnapRadius
static bool CanSnap(bool held, bool kinematic)
static float BottomAlignDelta(float slotY, float boundsMinY)
static int NearestFreeSlot(Vector3 tubePos, IReadOnlyList<Vector3> slotPos,
```

### `TubeRackSlots` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TubeRackSlots.cs`</sub>

Runtime half of the workspace tube holders: watches every kit-testtube in the lab and seats a released one into the nearest free Slot_* anchor. A seated tube is frozen kinematic (the same end state DropRespawn's settle-freeze produces, so the physics policy chain — grab → dynamic → release — keeps working); grabbing it back frees the slot. One component per holder, wired by "Name Tubes + Build Rack Slots".

```csharp
void Bind()
int SlotCount
```

### `TutorialHighlighter` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/TutorialHighlighter.cs`</sub>

Drives Tutorial Mode's guidance off the task graph: whatever step is available right now, its objects glow. ⭐ It NEVER decides that a step is DONE. This is a pure read of AvailableTasks(); the task completes through its existing binding exactly as in campaign, and the glow follows on the next poll because the available set changed. Since no parallel completion detector exists, the guidance cannot disagree with the game — which is the whole failure mode the W5.34 hint audit was spent unpicking.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r)
void Detach()
static bool ShouldLight(TaskTarget target, bool held, bool taskAvailable)
static bool GuidanceAllowed(bool running, bool skipping)
static bool IsHeld(Transform t)
void SetGlowMaterials(Material source, Material target)
```

### `VerbKind` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/VerbDemoMath.cs`</sub>

Which motion a step is asking for. DERIVED in TutorialTargets.Build() from the component that actually completes the step — never authored per task, for the same reason the target sweep is derived: an authored list drifts from the binding it describes, and a demonstration that mimes the wrong verb is worse than none. Deliberately only FIVE. Heat, chill, weigh, litmus, flame and collect are all "carry this vessel to that tool", so they share `Place` rather than each earning a bespoke curve that would look identical on screen.

### `VerbPose` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/VerbDemoMath.cs`</sub>

Where the demonstration ghost is, at a moment in its loop.

```csharp
Vector3 position
Quaternion rotation
```

### `VerbDemoMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/VerbDemoMath.cs`</sub>

Pure motion curves for Tutorial Mode's verb demonstration (W5.39): given a verb and two world points, where should the ghost be at normalised time t? Pure so the suite can pin the SHAPE of each motion without a headset — that a pour actually tips past horizontal, that a stir completes real revolutions, that a travel arc never sinks through the bench. A curve that looks plausible in code and does nothing useful in VR is exactly what this file exists to prevent. No hand is modelled. The ghost is a copy of the object the player must move, which is both cheaper (no rig, no clips, no new art) and clearer: the thing that moves on screen is the thing they have to pick up.

```csharp
const float ArcHeight
const float PourTiltDeg
const float WorkHeight
const float CircleRadius
const float ScoopDipDepth
const float ScoopTipDeg
const float DefaultRevs
static float Ease(float t)
static float Phase(float t, float a, float b)
static Vector3 Arc(Vector3 from, Vector3 to, float t01)
static float StirAngleDeg(float t01, float revs
static Vector3 TiltAxis(Vector3 from, Vector3 to)
static VerbPose Sample(VerbKind kind, float t01, Vector3 from, Vector3 to,
```

### `VerbDemoPlayer` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/VerbDemoPlayer.cs`</sub>

Tutorial Mode's verb demonstration (W5.39): a translucent ghost of the object the player has to move, miming the actual motion of the step, twice, then gone. ⭐ Deliberately NOT a hand. Rigging and animating a pair of hands is days of art for a hint, and it answers the wrong question — the player already knows what a hand looks like. Ghosting the BOTTLE tells them which object moves, from where, to where, and how it is held at the end of the motion. The mesh-copy machinery is the same one TutorialHighlighter's glow shell already proved. Fires only on request (coach level 2, or poking Pharmee for help). Never loops ambiently: a permanently miming ghost is noise, and it would compete with the glow for the player's attention instead of reinforcing it.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, Material ghost)
void SetGhostMaterial(Material m)
bool IsPlaying
static bool Endpoints(IReadOnlyList<TaskTarget> targets,
void Show(string taskId)
void ShowCurrent()
void Stop()
```

### `VesselStatus` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/VesselStatus.cs`</sub>

Live contents readout on a vessel's existing ProximityLabel (W5.8: "track the contents — texts that show when we hover or get near"). Throttled and change-gated so the TMP mesh only rebuilds when the state actually moves.

```csharp
void Bind(LiquidPhysics lp, ProximityLabel label, string displayName, float showDist
void Refresh()
```

### `WalkBob` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WalkBob.cs`</sub>

Subtle head-bob while the player is locomoting, for a grounded, "walking" feel. Applied to the XR camera's local offset so it never fights head tracking — and kept small + speed-scaled for VR comfort (bob only when actually moving). Amplitude is intentionally low; expose it so a comfort setting can zero it out.

```csharp
void SetAmplitude(float a)
```

### `WatchMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WatchMath.cs`</sub>

Pure fitted-watch geometry (edit-mode testable). The authored WatchModel is a SOLID Tripo mesh — a solid object can never encircle a wrist (user 2026-07-11: "perfectly neat and wrapped" like a real watch). Instead we MEASURE the hand mesh's wrist cross-section and generate an elliptical band around it, with a disc face on top. Everything here is deterministic math on plain data.

```csharp
const float BandClearance
const float BandTube
const float MinHalfWidth
const float MinHalfHeight
const float MaxHalfWidth
const float MaxHalfHeight
```

### `WristSlice` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WatchMath.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static WristSlice MeasureSlice(IList<Vector3> points, float sliceZ, float tol)
static Vector2 BandRadii(Vector2 wristHalfExtents)
static float FaceDiameter(float bandRadiusX)
static Mesh BuildBandMesh(Vector2 radii, float tube, int loopSegs, int tubeSegs)
```

### `WaterBathMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WaterBathController.cs`</sub>

Pure rules for the ZONE-FREE water bath (user 2026-07-17: "I don't want any zone. The entire lab IS the zone. The tools themselves function when brought together ANYWHERE"). The bath is a real tool with real requirements, exactly like the manuscript's: fill it with water, put a lit burner under it, and it warms whatever vessel you bring to it — wherever in the lab it happens to sit.

```csharp
const float MinWaterMl
const float BathMaxC
const float BurnerRadius
const float VesselRadius
static bool HasWater(float waterMl)
static bool IsHeating(bool hasWater, bool litBurnerNear)
static float EffectRadius(float anchorScaleX, float fallback)
static string StatusLine(bool hasWater, bool litBurnerNear, float bathC)
```

### `WaterBathController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WaterBathController.cs`</sub>

The bath itself: LiquidPhysics holds the water the player pours in, TemperatureSim heats while a lit burner sits near, and every vessel brought close takes the bath's temperature — which is what releases temperature-gated reactions (Tollens mirror, ester odours, the hydrolysis boil) and satisfies VesselHeatTask steps. No station, no pad, no fixed position: carry the bath anywhere, it still works.

```csharp
Vector3 HeatZoneCenter
float HeatZoneRadius
float BurnerZoneRadius
float BathC
bool HasWater
void Bind(LiquidPhysics lp, TemperatureSim temp, ProximityLabel label)
void HeatVessel(LiquidPhysics vessel)
void DriveForTest(float dt)
```

### `VesselHeatTask` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WaterBathController.cs`</sub>

Completes a heat step ZONE-FREE: the task is done when this vessel has been served all its reagents AND actually reached the required temperature — however and wherever the player heated it. Replaces the old fixed Station_prep-hydrolysis (deleted with its pad/label/teleport anchor).

```csharp
string TaskId
float RequiredC
bool Relevant
static bool ShouldComplete(bool allReagentsIn, float tempC, float requiredC)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, float requiredC,
void Detach()
```

### `WaypointBeacon` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WaypointBeacon.cs`</sub>

Animates the waypoint marker: a circular glow that sits on the target surface (pulsing gently) and a downward arrow bobbing above it — a clear "go/act here" signal instead of an ambiguous floating blob. WaypointGuide moves the root; this only animates the children in local space.

```csharp
void SetParts(Transform arrowT, Transform glowT)
```

### `WaypointGuide` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WaypointGuide.cs`</sub>

Floats a marker/beacon above the station for the current available step, guiding the player where to go next (storyboard: "follow the markers"). Hides when nothing is available (between steps / finished).

```csharp
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void SetMarkerScale(float metresAtReference)
static float DistanceScale(float distance, float referenceDistance,
void SetPlacement(float height, float clearance, float front,
static Vector3 MarkerPosition(Bounds solid, float heightOffset, bool caged,
string CurrentTargetTaskId
```

### `WeighMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WeighMath.cs`</sub>

Pure weighing rules (W5.8): the balance pan auto-tares the vessel, so the display reads the CONTENTS in grams (1 g/ml proxy — real densities are out of scope per the client's record-only-yield ruling). The suite pins these.

```csharp
static float MassOf(float liquidMl, float solidG
static float PanMass(float contentsMlOrG, float rbMassKg)
static bool WithinTolerance(float massG, float targetG, float tolFrac
static bool PanSettled(float secondsOnPan, float minSeconds
```

### `WeighStation` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WeighStation.cs`</sub>

A functional balance (W5.8: "the weighing scale too"): whatever rests on the pan drives the live grams display (auto-tared contents, 1 g/ml proxy), and a weigh-* task completes once the CORRECT load sits settled on the pan — either a vessel holding enough of the required chemical (Aspirin: flask with ~50 ml Salicylic Acid) or the required tool (Acetone: the acetate scoopula). TaskGraph condition + ExperimentStarted resubscribe = Retry-safe (the ZoneSimStation pattern). The pan is a trigger volume over the Balance model.

```csharp
LabItem OccupantItem
LiquidPhysics OccupantVessel
string TaskId
float SecondsOnPan
bool SettledWith(LiquidPhysics lp)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, string requiredItemId,
void Register()
bool IsSatisfied
void ForceLoad(LabItem item, LiquidPhysics vessel, float secondsAgo)
void AutoFindScale()
bool HasScale
```

### `WeighingScaleController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WeighingScaleController.cs`</sub>

The balance's digital head. Drives the grams readout from a target mass, the way a bench balance does: the reading TYPES IN, wobbles while the load settles, then locks (user 2026-07-27: "add animation to the typing of the weight like how a real digital scale does"). All display maths is pure so the suite pins it without a scene.

```csharp
UnityEvent onTargetReached
float CurrentMass
string DisplayText
void Bind(TMP_Text display)
void Tick(float dt)
void SetTargetMass(float newTarget)
void AddMass(float delta)
void RemoveMass(float delta)
static float Reading(float shown, float target, float wobbleG, float phase)
static string Typed(string text, float t, float charsPerSecond)
static string Format(float grams, string unit)
```

### `WorkspaceShelfMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/WorkspaceShelfMath.cs`</sub>

Pure geometry for the center-table overhead shelf. W5.10 built one row of flush platform tiles on the gantry rails (front z=-3.15, back z=-3.50, tops y≈1.55). W5.12: the user hand-added a SECOND, lower row (plank centres y≈1.200) for the apparatus kits — this math now describes BOTH rows so the builder can rebuild them cleanly and the kit layout can target either. Values match the user's planks (row pitch, z centre, depth). Kept plain so the suite pins coverage + heights.

```csharp
const int Rows
const float Thickness
const float ZCenter
const float Depth
const float XMin
const float Gap
static float RowCenterY(int row)
const float TileCenterY
static float TopY
static float TopYOf(int row)
static float LowerRowHeadroom
static Vector3 TileCenter(int i, int count, int row
static Vector3 TileSize(int count)
static Vector3 LipCenter(int row
```

### `XRBottleUI` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/XRBottleUI.cs`</sub>

### `ZoneItemSensor` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ZoneItemSensor.cs`</sub>

Tracks whether the required grabbable LabItem is currently INSIDE this trigger volume (continuous occupancy, not one-shot completion). Rigs use this to run continuous verbs — e.g. the burner heats only while it sits in the heating zone, gas collects only while the collection tube is held in place.

```csharp
bool IsOccupied
string ItemId
LabItem Occupant
void SetItemId(string id)
void ForceOccupied(bool on)
void ForceOccupant(LabItem item)
```

### `ZoneSimStation` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Interaction/ZoneSimStation.cs`</sub>

Turns a layout zone station into a REAL sustained verb (generalising MethaneApparatusRig to every experiment): while the required prop occupies the zone the bound chemistry sim advances, and the station's task auto-completes via a TaskGraph condition once the sim reaches its target — the player must actually perform and hold the action, not just drop the prop in. Attached + configured by ExperimentSceneBuilder for stations whose layout sets a StationSim other than None. Deterministically testable (ForceOccupied + Tick).

```csharp
float heatSourceC
float heatTargetC
float filtrateMlPerSec
float gasMlPerSec
float heatRadius
string TaskId
StationSim Kind
void SetLoopAudio(SimLoopAudio loop)
void SetVfx(StationVfx vfx)
void SetIgnitionGate(System.Func<bool> gate)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner runner, string taskId, StationSim kind, ZoneItemSensor sensor,
void Register()
void Drive(float dt, bool occupied)
```

## Scoring

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/`

### `GradingConfig` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/ExperimentGrader.cs`</sub>

Tunables for how mistakes erode rubric sub-scores. Client-adjustable.

```csharp
float procedureMistakeStep
float safetyMistakeStep
float sanitationMistakeStep
```

### `ExperimentGrader` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/ExperimentGrader.cs`</sub>

Turns an experiment attempt's run-state (task completion + mistakes + time + quiz) into the per-criterion sub-scores, then the final GradeBreakdown via ScoreCalculator. This is the missing link between the TaskGraph/MistakeLog and the grade screen numbers (Grade %, per-criteria breakdown). Pure C#, unit-testable.

```csharp
ExperimentGrader(ScoreCalculator calc, GradingConfig cfg
```

### `BktParameters` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/MasteryModel.cs`</sub>

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing parameters (per module, tunable in the inspector). Defaults from plan §3.6.

```csharp
float pL0
float pTransit
float pSlip
float pGuess
```

### `MasteryModel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/MasteryModel.cs`</sub>

Bayesian Knowledge Tracing mastery estimator (plan §3.6, Logic Tier). Tracks P(learned) per LabSkill; the 90% gate reads OverallMastery(). Plain C# so the BKT math is unit-testable. One instance per experiment attempt.

```csharp
MasteryModel(BktParameters parameters, IEnumerable<LabSkill> trackedSkills)
IReadOnlyList<LabSkill> TrackedSkills
void Observe(LabSkill skill, bool correct)
bool IsTracked(LabSkill skill)
float GetMastery(LabSkill skill)
float OverallMastery()
bool IsMastered(float threshold)
void Reset()
```

### `RubricWeights` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/ScoreCalculator.cs`</sub>

Per-experiment rubric weights (WCC lab manual rubric, plan §3.6). Defaults sum to 1.0 but need not — ScoreCalculator normalizes, which handles the manual's inconsistent printed weights (flagged for client sign-off).

```csharp
float Total()
float WeightOf(RubricCategory c)
```

### `GradeBreakdown` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/ScoreCalculator.cs`</sub>

Per-criterion contribution and the final grade, all in percent (0..100).

```csharp
float Procedure
float ChemicalTests
float MaterialsAndPPE
float TimeManagement
float Sanitation
float Documentation
float Total
```

### `ScoreCalculator` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Scoring/ScoreCalculator.cs`</sub>

Turns per-criterion sub-scores (each 0..1) into a weight-normalized grade %. Split out of the original flow god-class as the audit asked; that class (ExperimentFlowManager) was finally deleted in 2026-08-07 once the split was complete and nothing in any scene referenced it.

```csharp
ScoreCalculator(RubricWeights weights)
GradeBreakdown Compute(IDictionary<RubricCategory, float> subScores)
static float TimeSubScore(float elapsedSeconds, float parSeconds)
```

---

## Progression

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/`

### `DemoConfig` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/DemoMode.cs`</sub>

Backend demo-mode switch (user 2026-07-10): panelists need a fast run-through with auto-complete controls, while Chapter-3 study participants must see the untouched normal flow. A config FILE decides whether the cube-room menu even shows the "Demo Mode" button; pressing that button starts a demo SESSION (separate throwaway save, all periods unlocked, HUD auto-complete controls, infinite reagents). Config off = zero footprint.

```csharp
bool demoEnabled
bool infiniteSupply
```

### `DemoMode` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/DemoMode.cs`</sub>

Pure config resolution + demo save-path mapping (edit-mode testable).

```csharp
static bool IsEnabled
static bool InfiniteSupply
static void SetResolved(DemoConfig config)
static DemoConfig Resolve(string persistentJson, string streamingJson)
static string ProductFor(string moduleId)
static bool IsEndProduct(string chemicalName)
static string SavePathFor(bool demoActive, string normalPath)
```

### `DemoSession` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/DemoMode.cs`</sub>

Whether THIS play session was entered through the Demo Mode button. (Static so it survives the menu→lab scene load, like GameFlow.SelectedModuleId.)

```csharp
static bool Active
```

### `DemoModeLoader` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/DemoModeLoader.cs`</sub>

Reads the demo-mode config at startup (on the Services GO in both scenes) and installs it into DemoMode. Two locations: • StreamingAssets/demo-config.json — the shipped default. On Android it lives INSIDE the APK, so it must be read via UnityWebRequest. • persistentDataPath/demo-config.json — the field override; wins when present.

```csharp
const string FileName
```

### `ExperimentPeriod` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ExperimentCatalog.cs`</sub>

The four progression periods the experiments are grouped into (plan §3.2). Period doors open in order once the previous period is fully passed.

### `CatalogEntry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ExperimentCatalog.cs`</sub>

One roster entry: its module id (must match the ExperimentModuleDefinition asset's moduleId), the asset file name, its period, the single prerequisite that gates it, and the build tier (1–3, informational).

```csharp
string moduleId
string assetName
string title
ExperimentPeriod period
string prerequisiteModuleId
int tier
CatalogEntry(string id, string asset, string title, ExperimentPeriod period, string prereq, int tier)
```

### `ExperimentCatalog` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ExperimentCatalog.cs`</sub>

The ordered 9-experiment roster — the client's 2026-07-16 period grouping, which is exactly the manuscript's 8 bench labs (Exp 2-9) plus the methane tutorial. (Manuscript Exp 1, Stoichiometry, is a pen-and-paper calc exercise, so it has no bench module.) Aspirin + Caffeine were game-authored, are absent from the grouping, and were dropped 2026-07-16 — Aspirin survives as a RAW REAGENT because Exp 2 §D hydrolyses it. Linear mastery chain: each experiment unlocks the next once its two-part 90% gate is cleared. Kept as plain data so the menu/hub/experiment-select and ProgressionFlow can drive off one source of truth, and so it is unit-testable without a scene.

```csharp
static readonly IReadOnlyList<CatalogEntry> Entries
static CatalogEntry Get(string moduleId)
static string PrerequisiteOf(string moduleId)
static IEnumerable<CatalogEntry> InPeriod(ExperimentPeriod period)
static int Count
```

### `ExperimentLibrary` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ExperimentLibrary.cs`</sub>

A runtime-safe registry of every ExperimentModuleDefinition, referenced directly (serialized asset refs — no Resources/AssetDatabase needed in a build). One asset instance is referenced by the ExperimentLauncher so any of the 9 experiments can be loaded by moduleId from the menu / period hub / experiment-select.

```csharp
List<ExperimentModuleDefinition> modules
ExperimentModuleDefinition Get(string moduleId)
bool Has(string moduleId)
int Count
```

### `GameFlow` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/GameFlow.cs`</sub>

Transient cross-scene game-flow state. The main menu / experiment-select writes the chosen experiment here, then loads the lab scene where ExperimentLauncher reads it. Kept deliberately tiny; persistent progress lives in ProgressionService/save file.

```csharp
static string SelectedModuleId
static void Select(string moduleId)
```

### `ProgressionFlow` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ProgressionFlow.cs`</sub>

Read-only view over a ProgressionService that answers the game-flow questions the menu / period hub / experiment-select screens ask: what's unlocked, what's next, which period doors are open, and overall completion. Uses ExperimentCatalog as the roster + prerequisite source of truth. Plain C# so it is unit-testable.

```csharp
ProgressionFlow(ProgressionService service) : this(service, false)
ProgressionFlow(ProgressionService service, bool unlockAll)
static ProgressionFlow Create(ProgressionService service)
bool IsUnlocked(string moduleId)
bool IsPassed(string moduleId)
CatalogEntry NextExperiment()
bool IsPeriodComplete(ExperimentPeriod period)
bool IsPeriodUnlocked(ExperimentPeriod period)
int PassedCount()
float OverallCompletion01()
bool AllComplete()
```

### `ModuleRecord` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ProgressionService.cs`</sub>

Per-module progress record (best attempt).

```csharp
string moduleId
float bestGrade
float bestMastery
bool passed
int attempts
```

### `ProgressSaveData` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ProgressionService.cs`</sub>

Versioned save payload.

```csharp
int version
List<ModuleRecord> modules
```

### `ProgressionService` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ProgressionService.cs`</sub>

Tracks which experiments the player has passed and persists it (versioned JSON with a backup slot, corruption-safe). Drives the mastery gate / period-door unlocking. Plain C# — the save path is injectable so it is unit-testable.

```csharp
const int CurrentVersion
ProgressionService(string path
ProgressSaveData Data
ModuleRecord GetRecord(string moduleId)
bool IsPassed(string moduleId)
bool IsUnlocked(string moduleId, string prerequisiteModuleId)
ModuleRecord RecordResult(string moduleId, ExperimentResult result, bool autoSave
void Save()
void Load()
void ResetAll()
```

### `ResultRecorder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ResultRecorder.cs`</sub>

Persists every finished attempt into the ProgressionService save file — the missing link between ExperimentRunner.ExperimentFinished and the unlock gates (without this, passes were never saved and nothing ever unlocked at runtime). Thin MonoBehaviour over the already-tested ProgressionService.RecordResult.

```csharp
event Action<ModuleRecord> Recorded
ModuleRecord LastRecord
string SavePathOverride
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
static ModuleRecord Record(ProgressionService svc, string moduleId, ExperimentResult result)
```

### `ResultRow` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ResultsExport.cs`</sub>

One row of the Results/History screen: an experiment's best attempt.

```csharp
string moduleId
string title
ExperimentPeriod period
bool attempted
bool passed
float bestGrade
float bestMastery
int attempts
```

### `ResultsExport` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/ResultsExport.cs`</sub>

The manuscript's analytics dashboard, descoped (plan §S2) to a local Results/History view + an exportable scores file. Pure C# over ProgressionService + ExperimentCatalog so it is unit-testable and drives both the screen and the export.

```csharp
static List<ResultRow> BuildRows(ProgressionService service)
static int PassedCount(ProgressionService service)
static string BuildCsv(ProgressionService service)
```

### `SceneAssetLibrary` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/SceneAssetLibrary.cs`</sub>

Runtime-safe name→asset lookup for the ExperimentSceneBuilder (serialized direct references, so it works in a build — no AssetDatabase/Resources). Holds the equipment prefabs and the reagent ChemicalData the layouts reference by name.

```csharp
List<GameObject> prefabs
List<ChemicalData> chemicals
GameObject GetPrefab(string n)
ChemicalData GetChemical(string n)
```

### `TutorialSession` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/TutorialSession.cs`</sub>

Tutorial Mode (2026-08-07): all 9 experiments unlocked, heavily guided (glow + waypoint + hint on the watch + always-on labels), and UNGRADED — no quiz, no grade screen, no BKT update, no save write, no unlock. Practice only; a run leaves no trace. Deliberately the same shape as DemoSession.Active: one static flag every consumer early-returns on, so the campaign path stays unchanged by construction rather than by testing.

```csharp
static bool Active
static bool HasPractised(string moduleId)
static void MarkPractised(string moduleId)
static void BeginSession()
static int PractisedCount
```

### `UnlockDiff` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/UnlockDiff.cs`</sub>

Pure helpers for the post-experiment return loop: what did this pass unlock (for Pharmee's announcement), and where does the rig go so the CAMERA lands on the front-door marker. No MonoBehaviours — edit-mode testable.

```csharp
static HashSet<string> UnlockedSet(ProgressionFlow flow)
static List<string> NewlyUnlocked(HashSet<string> before, ProgressionFlow after)
static string AnnouncementFor(IReadOnlyList<string> newIds)
```

### `TeleportMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Progression/UnlockDiff.cs`</sub>

Rig-vs-camera teleport math: an XR rig's origin is NOT the player's head, so landing the HEAD on a marker means offsetting the rig by the (yaw-corrected) head offset.

```csharp
static float RigYawFor(float markerYawDeg, float rigYawDeg, float camYawDeg)
static Vector3 RigPositionFor(Vector3 markerPos, float deltaYawDeg, Vector3 rigPos, Vector3 camPos)
```

---

## NPC

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/`

### `CutsceneData` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/CutsceneData.cs`</sub>

A VR-safe, data-driven cutscene: a sequence of subtitle "beats" with a Pharmee expression and duration. No XR-camera animation (comfort) — narrative is carried by subtitles + Pharmee staging + optional fades. Client-reviewable copy.

### `Kind` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/CutsceneData.cs`</sub>

### `Beat` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/CutsceneData.cs`</sub>

```csharp
Kind kind
List<Beat> beats
float TotalDuration()
```

### `CutsceneDirector` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/CutsceneDirector.cs`</sub>

Plays data-driven cutscenes at the right narrative moments by subscribing to the ExperimentRunner: Intro when the experiment starts, ReagentPrep when that phase completes, and Success/Failure when it finishes. Beats are delivered as Pharmee subtitles + face expressions (VR-safe; no camera animation). The end-cutscene ALWAYS plays (success OR failure variant) — a user requirement.

```csharp
CutsceneData Intro
CutsceneData ReagentPrep
CutsceneData Success
CutsceneData Failure
void SetLibrary(CutsceneLibrary lib)
UnityEvent onCutsceneStarted
UnityEvent onCutsceneFinished
bool IsPlaying
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
bool LoadForModule(string moduleId)
void SkipNextOutro()
CutsceneData SelectOutro(ExperimentResult r)
void Play(CutsceneData data)
void Skip()
```

### `CutsceneLibrary` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/CutsceneLibrary.cs`</sub>

moduleId → the four cutscenes for that experiment (Intro, ReagentPrep, Success, Failure). Lets the single scene CutsceneDirector serve all 9 experiments: on ExperimentStarted it swaps its set from here instead of holding one hand-wired set.

### `Entry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/CutsceneLibrary.cs`</sub>

```csharp
List<Entry> entries
Entry GetSet(string moduleId)
```

### `ExaminerNPC` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/ExaminerNPC.cs`</sub>

Dr. Jimenez — the assessment-mode examiner (plan §3.4) plus his proctor VOICE (user 2026-07-10: "populate more messages... improve their behaviors"). In experiments flagged assessmentMode he observes and gives NO hints (Pharmee also stays quiet); the `State`/`IsObserving` machine still reflects that flag exactly. Independently, whenever ANY run is active he proctors aloud: a stern greeting at the start, then occasional oversight remarks (never hints), each driving the rigged model's "Talking" bool for its duration and showing a subtitle if he has a narration channel. Movement is ProctorRoamer's job; this is his voice + state.

### `ExaminerState` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/ExaminerNPC.cs`</sub>

```csharp
ExaminerState State
bool IsObserving
bool IsTalking
string LastLine
static bool ShouldObserve(ExperimentModuleDefinition m)
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, Animator a, NPCNarrationController n)
void SpeakLine(string line)
float SecondsFor(string line)
```

### `FloatBob` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/FloatBob.cs`</sub>

Gentle hover animation for a floating character/prop (Pharmee): sinusoidal vertical bob plus a slight sway tilt and a bounded Perlin jitter ("alive" wiggle, client request 2026-07-09), around a movable home pose. Local-space so it composes with any parent motion; a mover may drive the home via SetHome.

```csharp
void SetApplyRotation(bool on)
Vector3 Home
void SetHome(Vector3 localPos)
void SetGiveWayOffset(Vector3 localOffset)
Vector3 GiveWay
void SetGestureOffset(Vector3 localOffset)
Vector3 Gesture
static Vector3 JitterOffset(float t, float speed, float amplitude)
```

### `GateState` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/GatekeeperModel.cs`</sub>

States of the door-gated game loop (confirmed client workflow 2026-07-09, post-experiment review flow redesigned 2026-07-11 per the user's plan): Pharmee blocks the lab door; the player picks Lab Tour or Campaign → episode → lab-coat → ready → the lab loads/resets → threshold warning → the period starts the moment they walk in → tests complete → Pharmee congratulates and fades the player to Dr. Jimenez's review corner (QuizIntro) → Jimenez briefs → the quiz (QuizTime, never score-gated — manuscript) → grade + outro + spoken remarks (ScoreReview) → Continue teleports home with a full lab/wearables reset (Returning) → Pharmee's quiz-completion debrief AT THE ENTRANCE (Debrief) → unlock announcement → repeat. Retry from the review corner re-arms at the door.

### `GateEvent` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/GatekeeperModel.cs`</sub>

### `GatekeeperModel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/GatekeeperModel.cs`</sub>

Pure, table-driven state machine for the Pharmee door gate. No Unity types — fully edit-mode testable; the thin PharmeeGatekeeper MonoBehaviour applies each transition to the scene (door blocker, panels, launcher, runner, fades).

```csharp
GateState State
string SelectedModuleId
bool IsLabTour
event Action<GateState, GateState> Transition
bool Fire(GateEvent e)
void ResetToBlocked()
static GateState Next(GateState s, GateEvent e)
static bool DoorOpen(GateState s)
static bool RequiresPPEToOpen(GateState s)
static bool IsReviewState(GateState s)
ExperimentPeriod PickedPeriod
bool ChooseEpisode(ExperimentPeriod period, Func<string, bool> canSelect,
bool ChooseModule(string moduleId, Func<string, bool> canSelect)
static string FirstPlayableInPeriod(ProgressionFlow flow, ExperimentPeriod period)
```

### `IloCopy` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/IloCopy.cs`</sub>

Intended Learning Outcomes per experiment (user 2026-07-10: Pharmee states the session's objectives in the opening dialogue). The 8 manuscript modules use the VERBATIM Appendix C "Objectives" text (transcribed in Docs/manuscript-reconciliation.md §2 — the chemistry authority); Methane is game-authored in the same voice and is client-CONFIRMED (2026-07-16) as the tutorial. (Aspirin + Caffeine were dropped 2026-07-16 with their modules.)

```csharp
const string LeadIn
static string[] ForModule(string moduleId)
static float BeatSeconds(string line)
```

### `LabTourGuide` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/LabTourGuide.cs`</sub>

Location-triggered Lab Tour (storyboard, 2026-07-10): instead of narrating on a timer, Pharmee points each area out as the player physically walks up to it — workbench, equipment cabinet, reagent shelf — then signs off once they've seen them all. Started/stopped by PharmeeGatekeeper; speaks through its narration via a callback. Landmarks resolve by name (no scene wiring); if none resolve the gatekeeper falls back to the timed sequence. Pure proximity core is self-tested.

### `Stop` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/LabTourGuide.cs`</sub>

```csharp
bool IsActive
int VisitedCount
int StopCount
Transform CurrentLandmark
int Begin(Action<string> say)
void End()
static int FirstUnvisitedInRange(Vector3 playerPos, Vector3[] landmarkPos, bool[] visited, float[] radii)
static readonly string[] DefaultBeatTexts
void SeedDefaults()
```

### `ModuleCutsceneController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/ModuleCutsceneController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
UnityEvent onCutscenesFinished
void PlayCutscenes()
void SkipCutscenes()
```

### `NPCNarrationController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/NPCNarrationController.cs`</sub>

### `NarrationLine` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/NPCNarrationController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
UnityEvent onNarrationFinished
event Action<string, float> LineStarted
event Action LineEnded
bool IsSpeaking
bool Typewriter
float TypeCps()
int VisibleCount
bool IsRevealing
static float HoldSecondsAfterReveal(float authoredWait, float revealSeconds, float minHold
void SetPanelRoot(GameObject g)
void BindVoice(VoiceBank bank, VoiceSpeaker who)
AudioClip ResolveVoice(string subtitle)
void SetVoiceBlip(string key, float volume
void PlayTutorialNarration()
```

### `PharmeeAttitude` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeAttitude.cs`</sub>

Pharmee flight attitude (user 2026-07-10): lean the body into the movement direction so he reads as flying through air, pulse the hover waves at his base, and add a gentle bob-nod while he talks. Composes with FaceCamera (root yaw) and FloatBob (position) by twisting only the body CHILD. W5.38: also folds in the GESTURE pose (PharmeeGestureMath) and aims the model's two hand pivots. Everything still lands in the ONE localRotation assignment below - this class is the sole writer of bodyRoot, and a second component writing it would silently lose or fight per-frame. The model has no skeleton (no skins, no joints, no LimbNodes in either RobotNPC.glb or .fbx), so all of this is procedural by necessity as well as by choice.

```csharp
void Bind(Transform body, Transform[] waveRings, FloatBob b, NPCNarrationController n)
void BindHands(Transform left, Transform right)
void SetPose(PharmeePose pose)
static float LeanFor(float speedMps, float degPerMps, float maxDeg)
```

### `PharmeeFaceExpression` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeBrain.cs`</sub>

Pharmee's expressions, driven onto the robot's screen-face (material/animator).

### `PharmeeState` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeBrain.cs`</sub>

Pharmee's behavioural states.

### `IPharmeeFace` <sub>interface</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeBrain.cs`</sub>

Optional visual face — implemented by the robot's face material/animator layer.

### `PharmeeBrain` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeBrain.cs`</sub>

Robot-guide brain: reacts to ExperimentRunner events with subtitle dialogue and a face expression (user requirement: "NPC robot must have dialogues"). Greets on start, instructs the current step, warns on mistakes, celebrates or encourages at the end. Dialogue lives in serialized data (client-reviewable); step instructions come from each task's hint.

### `DialogueSet` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeBrain.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void SetSubtitlePace(float speed)
bool AssessmentMode
PharmeeState State
string LastLine
PharmeeFaceExpression LastExpression
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void InstructCurrent()
static string InstructionFor(ExperimentTask task)
```

### `PharmeeFace` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeFace.cs`</sub>

Concrete face for Pharmee: tints the screen-face renderer(s) per expression. Implements IPharmeeFace so PharmeeBrain/PharmeeGatekeeper drive it. Point faceRenderers at the robot's eye/mouth meshes; the color property matches the shader (_EmissionColor for an emissive screen, else _BaseColor). Uses a MaterialPropertyBlock — no material instantiation, edit-mode safe. Default = HAPPY (user 2026-07-10: happy by default, especially while following).

```csharp
PharmeeFaceExpression Current
void BindRenderers(params Renderer[] rs)
void ResetToDefault()
void SetExpression(PharmeeFaceExpression e)
```

### `PharmeeGatekeeper` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGatekeeper.cs`</sub>

Thin scene driver for the GatekeeperModel: applies each state to the world — door blocker on/off, Pharmee lines, the door choice panel, stage loading with fades, and the walk-in run start. All heavy logic lives in the pure model.

### `GateLines` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGatekeeper.cs`</sub>

```csharp
GateLines Lines
GatekeeperModel Model
static readonly ExperimentPeriod[] EpisodeRows
void SetSubtitlePace(float speed)
static bool ShouldEnterReview()
void OnApproachTriggerEntered()
void OnPharmeeTalk()
void OnThresholdTriggerEntered()
void OnPPEWorn()
void OnPanelOption(int index)
static bool ReviewFlowActive
```

### `PharmeeGesture` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGestureMath.cs`</sub>

What Pharmee's body is doing right now, on top of his hover. Deliberately NOT a new state enum: `PharmeeState` (PharmeeBrain.cs) already IS the set, and already drives his line pool, his face and his beep. This is the fourth mapping off the same state, not a parallel machine.

### `PharmeePose` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGestureMath.cs`</sub>

One frame of gesture, in the four channels Pharmee actually has.

```csharp
Quaternion bodyRot
Vector3 rootOffset
float handRaise
float waveFlare
static PharmeePose Rest
```

### `PharmeeGestureTuning` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGestureMath.cs`</sub>

Tunable magnitudes, passed in rather than read from statics so the suite can drive them and the inspector can retune them without a code change. Real motion always needs a calibration knob - the right amplitude is a headset judgement, not an editor one.

```csharp
float nodDegrees
float pointLeanDegrees
float warnRecoilDegrees
float warnShakeDegrees
float celebrateRise
float celebrateSpinDegrees
float celebrateFlare
static PharmeeGestureTuning Default
```

### `PharmeeGestureMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGestureMath.cs`</sub>

Pure gesture curves - no Time.time, no transforms, no Unity state. Every value is a function of (gesture, seconds since it started, tuning), which is what makes the whole animation set checkable in edit mode. There is no headset pass available, so anything that cannot be pinned cannot be trusted. Precedents this matches exactly: PharmeeAttitude.LeanFor, PharmeeGiveWay.SideStep, FloatBob.JitterOffset, LabTourGuide.FirstUnvisitedInRange, SpeakerLedBlink.Level01.

```csharp
static float DurationOf(PharmeeGesture g)
static bool IsSustained(PharmeeGesture g)
static PharmeeGesture ForState(PharmeeState s)
static PharmeeGesture ForGate(GateState s)
static PharmeePose Pose(PharmeeGesture g, float t, PharmeeGestureTuning tune)
static float Envelope(float u)
static float EaseInOut(float u)
```

### `PharmeeGestures` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGestures.cs`</sub>

root-motion-free"). `PharmeeState` already selects his line pool, his face and his beep. This adds the fourth mapping - state to body - and nothing else. It is deliberately THIN: all the curves live in the pure `PharmeeGestureMath` so the suite can pin them, because there is no headset pass available to judge them by eye. It writes NO transform. Like `PharmeeMover` and `PharmeeGiveWay`, it feeds the two components that own Pharmee's transforms: * position -> `FloatBob.SetGestureOffset` (one more term in FloatBob's single sum) * rotation + hands + rings -> `PharmeeAttitude.SetPose` (folded into its single localRotation assignment) Adding a component that wrote `Robot Origin` directly would fight `PharmeeAttitude`, which overwrites it absolutely every LateUpdate.

```csharp
void Bind(PharmeeAttitude a, FloatBob b, PharmeeBrain br, ExperimentRunner r, LabTourGuide t)
void SetTuning(PharmeeGestureTuning t)
PharmeeGesture Current
void Play(PharmeeGesture g)
```

### `PharmeeGiveWay` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeGiveWay.cs`</sub>

Pharmee steps aside when the player walks into him (user 2026-07-10: "give way when I bump into him — I'm trying to go that way but he's blocking it"). While the player is inside his personal-space bubble, he drifts laterally out of their path (to whichever side he's already on, so he clears their forward direction), then eases back once they pass. Additive on top of FloatBob's home + bob, so it composes with the follow/hover behaviour instead of fighting it.

```csharp
void Bind(FloatBob b, Transform bodyXform, Transform p)
static Vector3 SideStep(Vector3 pharmeePos, Vector3 playerPos, Vector3 playerForward,
```

### `PharmeeLines` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeLines.cs`</sub>

Rich dialogue pools for the NPCs (user 2026-07-10: "populate more messages and interactions for Pharmee and Dr. for a rich gameplay"). Pure static data + a deterministic picker so the self-tests can pin variety without RNG. Pharmee rotates through these instead of repeating one canned line; Dr. Jimenez draws his stern examiner remarks from the exam pools. Client-reviewable copy (the §5 dialogue sign-off still applies).

```csharp
static readonly string[] Greetings
static readonly string[] Praise
static readonly string[] Celebrate
static readonly string[] Encourage
static readonly string[] Idle
static readonly string[] WrongReagent
static readonly string[] WrongStep
static readonly string[] Overheat
static readonly string[] Safety
static readonly string[] ExamGreeting
static readonly string[] ExamRemarks
const string TutorialOrientation
const string TutorialPreview
static readonly string[] TestsDoneLines
```

### `PharmeeMood` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeMood.cs`</sub>

Keeps Pharmee's face in sync with what he's doing (user 2026-07-10: expressions depend on what he's saying; HAPPY by default, especially while following you). PharmeeBrain/PharmeeGatekeeper set the per-line expression when a line starts; this component resets the face to its default (happy) when the line ENDS, so he never gets stuck on a warning face while floating after the player.

```csharp
void Bind(NPCNarrationController n, PharmeeFace f)
static PharmeeFaceExpression ExpressionForGate(GateState s)
```

### `PharmeeMoveSolver` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeMover.cs`</sub>

Pure hover-follow math for Pharmee's in-lab movement: pick the anchor nearest the player (with hysteresis so he doesn't ping-pong), glide toward it at a clamped speed, and never crowd the player. Edit-mode testable.

```csharp
static int PickAnchor(Vector3 playerPos, IReadOnlyList<Vector3> anchors,
static Vector3 Step(Vector3 current, Vector3 target, float maxSpeed, float dt)
```

### `PharmeeMover` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeeMover.cs`</sub>

Runtime driver: while an experiment runs, Pharmee glides between hover anchors to stay near (but not on top of) the player — "he follows and watches me work". When idle he returns to his door-home. Drives FloatBob's home so bob + jitter keep composing on top of the motion.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, FloatBob b, Transform p, Transform[] a)
void TickSolve(float dt)
```

### `PharmeePoke` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/PharmeePoke.cs`</sub>

Makes Pharmee interactable: poking/selecting the robot repeats the current step's guidance (PharmeeBrain.InstructCurrent). Debounced so rapid pokes don't spam the narration.

```csharp
void SetBrain(PharmeeBrain b)
void Poke()
```

### `ProctorRoamModel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/ProctorRoamModel.cs`</sub>

Pure state machine for Dr. Jimenez's proctor roaming (user 2026-07-10: "roam around the room time to time, observing us or looking at assets like the shelf… walk back to his original position to facilitate the quiz"). No Unity types. Loop: AtHome (idle a while) → WalkingOut (to the next observation point) → Observing (look at it) → WalkingHome → AtHome … . Round-robin over the points with a deterministic idle-time jitter (seeded — testable). When roaming is disallowed (quiz/post-lab time) any outing is cut short and he heads home.

### `Phase` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/ProctorRoamModel.cs`</sub>

```csharp
Phase Current
int TargetIndex
ProctorRoamModel(int pointCount, float idleMin
bool Tick(float dt, bool allowRoam, bool arrived)
bool IsWalking
```

### `ProctorRoamer` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/NPC/ProctorRoamer.cs`</sub>

Thin driver for ProctorRoamModel on Dr. Jimenez: walks him between his home post and the observation points (shelf/benches), faces the walk direction, plays the Walk animator state while moving, and glances at the point (or the player) while observing. Roaming pauses (he returns home) from the moment an experiment FINISHES until the next one starts — home is where he proctors the quiz.

```csharp
ProctorRoamModel Model
void Bind(Animator a, ExperimentRunner r, List<Transform> points)
void ReturnHomeAndHold(Transform faceTarget
static bool StuckTick(ref float timer, float movedSq, float dt, float giveUpSeconds)
```

## UI

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/`

### `ChecklistPager` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ChecklistPager.cs`</sub>

Focused checklist text for the holo procedures board (user 2026-07-10: the flat pads rendered every phase at full detail into a fixed rect, so long checklists overflowed and overlaid the reaction footer — unreadable). Instead of shrinking text to fit, collapse what the player doesn't need: completed phases fold to a "done n/n" line, future phases to a "(n steps)" stub, and only the ACTIVE phase renders its full step list. Line count is bounded by construction (phases + longest single phase), so the text always fits its rect at a readable size.

```csharp
static TaskPhase? ActivePhase(TaskGraph graph)
static string BuildObjectivesHeader(ExperimentModuleDefinition module)
static string BuildMaterialsHeader(ExperimentModuleDefinition module)
static string BuildFocusedText(TaskGraph graph)
static string BuildHeader(ExperimentRunner runner)
```

### `ChemLabelUpdater` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ChemLabelUpdater.cs`</sub>

```csharp
ChemicalData chemicalData
Text uiText
TMP_Text tmpText
bool applyReadableStyle
Color readableColor
```

### `ChoicePanelController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ChoicePanelController.cs`</sub>

Reusable world-space option dialog (door gate, confirms): a title plus up to N option buttons. Buttons carry persistent int-arg listeners → OnOption(i); code listens on OptionChosen. All refs optional so it is edit-mode testable.

```csharp
event Action<int> OptionChosen
bool IsOpen
void Bind(GameObject panelRoot, TMP_Text title, Button[] buttons, TMP_Text[] labels)
void Show(string title, IList<string> options, IList<bool> interactable
void ShowMessage(string title, string confirmLabel)
void Hide()
void OnOption(int index)
string LabelAt(int i)
```

### `ComfortMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ComfortApplier.cs`</sub>

Pure mapping from comfort settings to the values the live systems consume (§5 settings apply-listeners) — separated so the self-tests pin the curves.

```csharp
static Vector3 HudScale(Vector3 baseScale, float textScale)
static float ApertureFor(float intensity01)
static float LineSecondsFor(float baseSeconds, float speed)
```

### `ComfortApplier` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ComfortApplier.cs`</sub>

Applies ComfortSettings to the live scene whenever SettingsService raises Changed: HUD/text scale, snap-turn angle, tunneling vignette strength, and Pharmee subtitle pacing. All targets optional — the applier works with whatever the scene has (the menu scene has fewer targets than the lab).

```csharp
static readonly int GuideSteadyProperty
void Bind(Transform hud, SnapTurn turn, Vignette vig, PharmeeBrain b, PharmeeGatekeeper g)
void Apply(ComfortSettings s)
```

### `DemoButtonVisibility` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/DemoButtonVisibility.cs`</sub>

Shows/hides the cube-room "Demo Mode" button from the config file's verdict. Lives on an always-active parent (the menu panel) because a disabled button can't re-enable itself — and the config loads asynchronously on Android, so this polls rather than checking once. [ExecuteAlways] so it also reflects the config in the Editor Scene view (the button shows without entering Play mode).

```csharp
void Bind(GameObject button)
```

### `DemoHudController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/DemoHudController.cs`</sub>

The demo HUD cluster (Skip Step / Finish Experiment / Auto-Answer Quiz), visible only during a demo session and only when each verb applies. Built by Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Demo ▸ Build Demo HUD; buttons call the On* methods.

```csharp
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r, PostLabController p,
static bool SkipAllowed(bool demo, bool tutorial, bool running, bool review)
void OnSkipStep()
void OnFinishExperiment()
void OnAutoQuiz()
```

### `ExperimentHudController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ExperimentHudController.cs`</sub>

Screen/world HUD: module title, count-up timer, progress bar, and task-accomplished toasts. Subscribes to ExperimentRunner — no polling except the once-per-second timer text. The visible progress bar drops on mistakes (storyboard behaviour) while the underlying TaskGraph progress stays clean.

```csharp
static float DisplayedProgress(float graphProgress01, int mistakes, float penaltyStep)
static string FormatPercent(float p01)
static string FormatTime(float seconds)
```

### `FaceCamera` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/FaceCamera.cs`</sub>

Rotates a world-space label or canvas to face the player's camera every frame, so text stays readable from any side (never mirrored / seen from behind). Y-axis mode keeps signs upright; full mode also pitches toward the viewer.

```csharp
bool yAxisOnly
float yawOffset
bool faceTowardCamera
bool preserveInitialTilt
```

### `GlyphSafe` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/GlyphSafe.cs`</sub>

The world-space lab UI (tablet "pads", wrist holo board, reaction footer) renders with LiberationSans SDF, whose baked atlas is missing arrows, Greek and box glyphs (→ ← ↑ ↓ Δ ⇌ ☑ ☐ ▶ …). Those showed as blank "missing-glyph" boxes on the tablets. Rather than degrade the source chemistry data or regenerate the font atlas (fragile), we map the unsupported glyphs to font-safe equivalents at DISPLAY time. Pure + tested.

```csharp
static string Sanitize(string s)
```

### `GradeDisplay` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/GradeDisplay.cs`</sub>

Pure display rules for grades (W5.9): the pass gate compares RAW values (Total >= 90), so displayed percentages must FLOOR — rounding 89.6 up to "90%" beside a TRY AGAIN verdict read as a contradiction. Suite-pinned.

```csharp
static int Percent(float raw)
static int MasteryPercent(float raw01)
```

### `GradeScreenController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/GradeScreenController.cs`</sub>

End-of-experiment grade screen. Populated from an ExperimentResult: overall grade %, mistakes, time, per-criteria breakdown, and PASSED / TRY AGAIN based on the two-part gate. Retry/Continue are wired via UnityEvents.

```csharp
UnityEvent onRetry
UnityEvent onContinue
UnityEvent onBackToEntrance
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void Show(ExperimentResult r)
void ShowPractice(int stepsDone, int corrections, System.Action onDone)
void Hide()
void OnRetryPressed()
void OnContinuePressed()
void OnBackPressed()
void SetBackButton(GameObject b)
static string BuildBreakdown(ExperimentResult r)
```

### `HoloScroller` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HoloScroller.cs`</sub>

Scroll driver for the holo procedures board (user 2026-07-12: the instruction text rendered as one continuous row and couldn't be read — the body now wraps inside a masked viewport and this scrolls it). Big ▲/▼ page buttons are the primary VR affordance (poke/ray-friendly); the ScrollRect still accepts direct drag. Pure page math kept static so the suite pins the clamping.

```csharp
static float NextPage(float current01, float pageFrac, int direction)
void Bind(ScrollRect sr)
void PageUp()
void PageDown()
void SnapToTop()
```

### `HoverInfoPanel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HoverInfoPanel.cs`</sub>

The floating info card the hover-inspector shows when you point at a piece of equipment, a reagent bottle or an NPC (user 2026-07-10). It smoothly fades and scales in/out and rides a comfortable distance in front of you along the line to the pointed object, always billboarded and readable. Pure easing helpers so the animation curve is unit-testable; HoverInspector feeds it entries.

```csharp
static float Ease(float t)
static float PlaceDistance(float dist, float near, float far, float standoff)
static Color AccentFor(LabInfoCategory c)
void Show(LabInfoEntry e, Vector3 worldAnchor)
void Hide()
bool IsVisible
static string Tag(LabInfoCategory c)
```

### `HubSelectController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HubSelectController.cs`</sub>

Period hub + experiment-select. Presents the 11-experiment roster grouped by period with per-entry state (locked / available / passed) driven by the ProgressionFlow gate, and launches the chosen experiment into the lab scene. The presentation model (BuildModel/StateOf) and the launch gate (CanSelect) are pure statics so they are unit-testable without a scene or disk.

### `RowState` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HubSelectController.cs`</sub>

### `Row` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HubSelectController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static List<Row> BuildModel(ProgressionFlow flow)
static RowState StateOf(Row r)
static bool CanSelect(ProgressionFlow flow, string moduleId)
void Refresh()
bool Select(string moduleId)
```

### `HudDialogueBar` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudDialogueBar.cs`</sub>

Screen-bottom dialogue bar (storyboard style): the speaker's portrait + name + the line they are currently speaking, mirrored from NPCNarrationController so the player can read them without looking at them. Visible ONLY while a line is live; fades out smoothly when the line ends. MULTI-SPEAKER (user 2026-07-19: "let's make dr jimenez same as pharmee that appears in our HUD as well"). Pharmee and Dr. Jimenez own SEPARATE NPCNarrationControllers (their own world bubbles); the bar used to subscribe to exactly one, so Jimenez's briefing/verdict never reached the HUD at all and the "Pharmee" name was baked into the scene text. Now each channel carries its own name + portrait, and whichever speaks last owns the bar.

### `Channel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudDialogueBar.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void Bind(NPCNarrationController n, GameObject root, TMP_Text speaker, TMP_Text line)
void Bind(NPCNarrationController n, GameObject root, TMP_Text speaker, TMP_Text line,
void HandleLineStarted(string line, float seconds)
void HandleLineEnded()
```

### `HudFollowSolver` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudFollowSolver.cs`</sub>

Pure math for a lazy-follow VR HUD: the canvas hovers a fixed distance in front of the head and only re-centres when the head strays outside a yaw/position deadzone — the accepted comfort pattern for "screen-anchored" HUDs (a hard head-lock is nauseating in VR). Static + stateless so it is edit-mode testable.

### `Params` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudFollowSolver.cs`</sub>

### `State` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudFollowSolver.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static float DeltaYawDeg(float fromDeg, float toDeg)
static Vector3 AnchorPoint(Vector3 headPos, float headYawDeg, in Params p)
static bool OutsideDeadzone(in State s, Vector3 headPos, float headYawDeg, in Params p)
static void Step(ref State s, Vector3 headPos, float headYawDeg, in Params p, float dt)
static State Snapped(Vector3 headPos, float headYawDeg, in Params p)
```

### `HudMenuDropdown` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudMenuDropdown.cs`</sub>

Collapses the HUD's Settings/Restart/Quit actions behind a single icon button — plus the demo verbs (Skip Step / Finish Experiment / Auto-Answer Quiz), which live in the same list and are shown only during a demo session (user 2026-07-15). The icon's onClick calls Toggle(); each action button's onClick also calls Close() so the list dismisses after a pick. Starts hidden. The action buttons keep their own LabMenuController / DemoHudController wiring untouched.

```csharp
void SetList(GameObject panel)
void Toggle()
void Close()
static float HeightFor(int items, float itemHeight, float gap, float pad)
```

### `HudRigController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudRigController.cs`</sub>

Driver for the HUD canvas. Two modes: ScreenLocked (default, storyboard style) — the canvas is rigidly glued to the camera every frame (full rotation), so pills sit at fixed screen corners. LazyFollow — comfort mode: hovers ahead and only re-centres outside a deadzone (kept as an option; some players find head-locked UI fatiguing on-device).

### `Mode` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/HudRigController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
Mode CurrentMode
HudFollowSolver.Params Follow
void SetCamera(Camera c)
void SnapToCamera()
```

### `LabInfoCategory` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/LabInfoDatabase.cs`</sub>

Knowledge base behind the hover-inspector pane (user 2026-07-10): pointing at a piece of equipment, a reagent bottle or an NPC pops a card with its name and a short, learn-as-you-play blurb — "what it's for + how to use it" for apparatus, trivia + hazard for reagents. Pure + tested; the resolver (HoverInspector) feeds it a chemical name / prop name and gets back a ready-to-display entry.

### `LabInfoEntry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/LabInfoDatabase.cs`</sub>

```csharp
readonly string Title
readonly LabInfoCategory Category
readonly string Body
LabInfoEntry(string title, LabInfoCategory cat, string body)
```

### `LabInfoDatabase` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/LabInfoDatabase.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static string Norm(string s)
static LabInfoEntry Reagent(string chemicalName)
static LabInfoEntry Equipment(string candidate)
static LabInfoEntry Person(bool pharmee)
static int ReagentCount
static int EquipmentCount
```

### `LabMenuController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/LabMenuController.cs`</sub>

The HUD's top-right cluster inside the lab: Settings toggles the in-lab settings panel; Quit (confirm) fades back to the menu scene; Restart (confirm) rebuilds the whole stage — the panic button for misplaced props / physics lag.

### `Pending` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/LabMenuController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void Bind(GameObject settings, ChoicePanelController confirm,
void OnSettingsToggle()
void OnQuitToMenu()
void OnRestart()
void OnConfirmOption(int index)
static string RestartConfirmText(bool running)
```

### `MainMenuController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/MainMenuController.cs`</sub>

Drives the cube spawn-room menu: Laboratory enters the lab at the entrance (Pharmee's gate flow then handles episode choice); Tutorial enters the same lab in ungraded guided-practice mode with everything unlocked; Settings toggles the settings panel; Quit exits the game. Plus the config-gated amber Demo button. The lab scene's ExperimentLauncher reads GameFlow.SelectedModuleId on load; the methane TUTORIAL EXPERIMENT is a separate thing, reached inside the lab via Pharmee's episode picker — not this Tutorial MODE button.

```csharp
static string ResolveLabTarget(ProgressionFlow flow, string fallback)
void OnLaboratory()
void OnDemoLaboratory()
void OnTutorialLaboratory()
void OnSettings()
void OnQuit()
```

### `MenuRoomFx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/MenuRoomFx.cs`</sub>

Brings the cube spawn room to life: the neon trim breathes, the room lights drift and occasionally flicker, and one strip arcs like a loose connection. Everything is driven from ONE component with per-object phase offsets rather than a pile of animators — a room where every light pulses in lockstep reads as a single blinking prop, whereas offset phases read as a room that is alive. All colour work goes through MaterialPropertyBlocks so no shared material is touched (the trim material is used all over the room, and instancing it would leak into other scenes).

```csharp
void Bind(Renderer[] trim, Light[] lights)
static float Breath(float time, float speed, float phase)
```

### `MoveInstructionsOnTilt` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/MoveInstructionsOnTilt.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void ShowInstructions()
void CloseInstructions()
```

### `PostLabController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/PostLabController.cs`</sub>

The post-lab "Documentation" phase (manual's Data Sheet + quiz), shown on a world-space tablet once the Chemical Tests phase is complete. The player enters the module's multiple-choice questions; submitting completes the terminal data-sheet task and ends the attempt with the quiz score feeding the grader's Documentation criterion. All UI refs are optional so the open→answer→submit→finish logic is unit-testable headlessly (a scene-built canvas drives the same public methods).

```csharp
bool IsOpen
QuizBank Bank
int CurrentIndex
void SetRefs(ExperimentRunner r, QuizBankLibrary lib)
void SetAutoOpen(bool on)
void Open()
void OpenFor(QuizBank bank)
void OnOptionSelected(int optionIndex)
static bool CanGoBack(int index)
static bool CanGoNext(int index, int count)
void PreviousQuestion()
void NextQuestion()
void AnswerCurrent(int optionIndex)
void Answer(int questionIndex, int optionIndex)
```

### `ProcessReadout` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ProcessReadout.cs`</sub>

A live world-space readout floating over a vessel — an in-game instrument panel (user 2026-07-15: "add texts that reflect the temperature… other experiments that require heating will use these texts for monitoring"). Shows "Hard-glass tube / 62 C -> 120 C" while heating, or "Gas collection tube / Collecting 45%" while a gas fills, and tints from cool blue to hot orange. REUSABLE: attach to ANY heated vessel in ANY experiment and BindHeat() it to that vessel's TemperatureSim. It reuses the suite-pinned VesselStatusMath formats, so it reads identically to the station billboards. NOTE: this does NOT replace the thermometer apparatus — the thermometer stays on the bench for the experiments that call for it (client rule: all tools are always present). This is an extra monitoring aid, not a substitute.

```csharp
void BindHeat(string baseLabel, TemperatureSim temp, float targetC, float ambientC
void BindCollect(string baseLabel, GasCollection gas)
static bool ShouldShow(bool hasHeat, float currentC, float ambientC, bool hasGas, float fill01)
string Compose()
```

### `ProximityLabel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ProximityLabel.cs`</sub>

Shows a small floating name tag above an object only when the player's camera is within range — so apparatus and reagents identify themselves as you approach, without cluttering the lab with permanent labels. Builds its own world-space TMP child on first enable; billboards to the camera.

```csharp
void SetLabel(string text, float dist
const float TutorialRadiusMultiplier
static float VisibleRadius(float baseRadius, bool tutorial)
static bool ShouldShow(float distance, float baseRadius, bool tutorial, bool guided)
```

### `ResultsHistoryController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ResultsHistoryController.cs`</sub>

The local Results/History screen (plan §S2 — the descoped analytics dashboard): shows each experiment's best grade / mastery / attempts + overall completion, and writes a spreadsheet-ready CSV to persistentDataPath. Reads the live ProgressionService; the formatting is a pure static so it is unit-testable.

```csharp
void Show()
void Hide()
void Refresh()
static string BuildDisplayText(ProgressionService service)
void ExportCsv()
```

### `FadeState` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ScreenFader.cs`</sub>

Pure fade math: eased alpha ramp between targets. Edit-mode testable.

```csharp
float Alpha
bool Busy
void Begin(float toAlpha, float seconds)
float Step(float dt)
static float Ease01(float t)
static float Pulse01(float t01, float peak)
```

### `ScreenFader` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/ScreenFader.cs`</sub>

VR-safe screen fade: a black quad floating just in front of the camera (a screen-space canvas is unreliable in the XR compositor). One instance per scene, parented under the active camera. Used for teleports + scene loads.

```csharp
static ScreenFader Instance
FadeState State
void PulseWarning(Color tint, float seconds
static Action Compose(Action first, Action second)
void FadeOut(float seconds
void FadeIn(float seconds
void FadeAround(Action mid, float outSeconds
static void FadeOutThen(Action act, float seconds
```

### `Handedness` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/SettingsService.cs`</sub>

### `ComfortSettings` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/SettingsService.cs`</sub>

Plain, clamped comfort/accessibility settings (plan §3.9). Kept as a POCO so the clamping + defaults are unit-testable without PlayerPrefs or a scene.

```csharp
float textScale
float subtitleSpeed
float vignetteIntensity
float snapTurnAngle
bool seatedMode
Handedness handedness
bool reduceFlashing
void SetTextScale(float v)
void SetSubtitleSpeed(float v)
void SetVignette(float v)
void SetSnapTurnAngle(float deg)
ComfortSettings Clone()
static float SteadyGlobal(bool reduceFlashing)
```

### `SettingsService` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/SettingsService.cs`</sub>

Owns the live ComfortSettings, persists them to PlayerPrefs, and raises Changed so listeners (UI text scaler, tunneling vignette, snap-turn provider, subtitle controller, locomotion) re-apply. Audio volumes live in AudioService; this is the comfort/accessibility half of the Settings panel.

```csharp
static SettingsService Instance
ComfortSettings Settings
event Action<ComfortSettings> Changed
void Load()
void Save()
void SetTextScale(float v)
void SetSubtitleSpeed(float v)
void SetVignette(float v)
void SetSnapTurnAngle(float d)
void SetSeatedMode(bool on)
void SetHandedness(Handedness h)
void SetLeftHanded(bool on)
void SetReduceFlashing(bool on)
```

### `TabletChecklistController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/TabletChecklistController.cs`</sub>

Grab-able tablet's procedure card: Materials/Apparatus/Procedure checklist built from the module's graphTasks, auto-ticking as tasks complete, with the current available step marked. Also shows the balanced reaction footer. Renders a text checklist into a single TMP_Text (simple, robust); a per-item prefab version can layer on later. The line-building logic is a pure static so it is unit-testable.

```csharp
static string BuildChecklistText(TaskGraph graph)
static string PhaseLabel(TaskPhase p)
```

### `TimerController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/TimerController.cs`</sub>

### `TutorialCoach` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/TutorialCoach.cs`</sub>

Tutorial Mode's voice: the stuck-escalation ladder and the end-of-run summary. Both are "what practice mode says to a struggling player", and both read the same run counters, so they live together. ⚠ Level 3 deliberately speaks the task's EXISTING hint rather than new copy: 76 of 81 hint ACTION lines are voiced, and inventing coach dialogue would mean a fresh voice generation pass for every mistake class.

```csharp
const float NudgeAfter
static int LevelFor(float secondsOnStep)
static string SummaryText(int stepsDone, int corrections)
void Bind(ExperimentRunner r)
void Detach()
int StepsDone
int Corrections
void ShowSummary()
void HelpNow()
```

### `UIfuncs` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/UIfuncs.cs`</sub>

```csharp
GameObject[] views
void objectToggler(GameObject gameObject)
```

### `UiButtonSounds` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/UiButtonSounds.cs`</sub>

Adds audio feedback to a UI button: a soft blip when the pointer/ray hovers it and a click when it's pressed (user 2026-07-10). Works with the XR ray (XRUIInputModule dispatches pointer-enter/click to these handlers) and the desktop mouse. Attach to any Button's GameObject — no per-button wiring, no new clips.

```csharp
void SetKeys(string hover, string click)
void OnPointerEnter(PointerEventData _)
void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData _)
```

### `VesselStatusMath` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/VesselStatusMath.cs`</sub>

Pure format functions for the live-status feedback layer (W5.8): vessel name tags that show contents/volume, hover-card "Now:" lines, and station billboards that show temperature / sim progress. Kept plain so the suite pins every format. All output is TMP-safe ASCII except the em-dash, which the dialogue system already uses everywhere (LiberationSans has it); the degree glyph is deliberately avoided ("62 C", not "62°C").

```csharp
static string Compose(string displayName, string chemName, float ml)
static string ComposeMixed(string displayName, string ledgerSummary)
static string HoverLine(string chemName, float ml, string ledgerSummary, int ledgerCount)
static string HeatLine(string baseLabel, float currentC, float targetC)
static string TempGoalLine(float currentC, float targetC, bool chill)
static string ProgressLine(string baseLabel, string verb, float frac01)
```

### `WristWatchController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/UI/WristWatchController.cs`</sub>

Wrist-flip progress tracker (user's headline feature). Flipping the wrist so the watch face turns up (supination) while glancing toward it shows a compact panel: current step, progress %, mastery %. A button/thumbstick fallback toggles it so the feature works without the gesture (and is testable pre-HMD). Gesture detection is via the anchor transform's up-vector, which works for both controller supination and hand-tracking palm-up. Hysteresis prevents flicker.

```csharp
static bool SuppressNpcPokes
void BindHolo(GameObject panel, TMP_Text title, TMP_Text body)
void BindHolo(GameObject panel, TMP_Text title, TMP_Text summary, TMP_Text body, TMP_Text reaction)
void SetReaction(string reaction)
const float PreviewSeconds
void ShowProcedurePreview(float seconds
void CancelPreview()
static string StepText(string label, string hint, bool tutorial)
static string BuildSummary(ExperimentRunner runner)
static bool IsGazingAt(Vector3 headPos, Vector3 headForward, Vector3 targetPos, float dotThreshold)
```

## Safety

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/`

### `AcidCorrosion` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/AcidCorrosion.cs`</sub>

```csharp
float corrosionDuration
float initialVolume
float residualVolume
float audioFadeTime
DecalProjector decal
AudioSource fizzSound
ParticleSystem smokeParticles
Transform warningUI
```

### `FumeHoodZone` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/HazardZones.cs`</sub>

A fume-hood working volume. Tracks whether the player's hand / active work is inside it, so toxic/volatile reagents can require the hood (plan §3.7).

```csharp
bool IsOccupied
bool Contains(Vector3 worldPos)
```

### `FumeHoodStatusLabel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/HazardZones.cs`</sub>

Narrating label for the fume hood (2026-07-18, user: "how do we use the fumehood? does it open?"): the hood is an OPEN alcove — nothing to open or switch on; protection is purely WHERE the vessel is. The invisible WorkVolume made "am I in far enough?" a guess, so the label says what belongs inside and flips to a ✓ while a vessel is actually protected.

```csharp
void Bind(FumeHoodZone zone, ProximityLabel label)
static string StatusLine(string vesselInside)
```

### `HazardZone` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/HazardZones.cs`</sub>

A hazard volume (spill, hot surface, corrosive) — contact reports a mistake to the runner and can trigger a visual/audio warning. Debounced so a dwell reports once.

```csharp
void SetRunner(ExperimentRunner r)
void Configure(ExperimentRunner r, LabErrorType type, string msg)
void SetPlayerRoot(Transform root)
void SetArmedCheck(System.Func<bool> armed)
static bool IsPlayer(Transform other, Transform playerRoot)
void Report()
```

### `LabAlarm` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/LabAlarm.cs`</sub>

The lab's hazard alarm (manuscript intro: errors trigger a "visual and auditory alert, such as flashing lights, warning messages, or alarm beeps"). One red ceiling fixture + one dynamic light (Quest-cheap), flashing for a few seconds with the alarm SFX whenever a dangerous mix/overheat fires. Built by Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Lab Alarm; re-triggers extend the window.

```csharp
static LabAlarm Instance
void Bind(Light l, Renderer fixture)
static void Trigger()
void TriggerNow()
static bool FlashOn(float sinceStart, float period)
```

### `PPEController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/PPEController.cs`</sub>

PPE donning at the locker. Since 2026-07-10 the three pieces — lab coat, goggles, gloves — are donned INDIVIDUALLY (click each locker item; `PPEDonOnSelect` forwards the clicks here) and ALL THREE are required before an experiment can start (`PPEWorn` == all worn — the gate checks it). Per-piece visuals: coat + goggles + gloves appear on the mirror avatar (PlayerAvatar layer — mirror-only), and the gloves ALSO appear first-person on the controllers. `PPEWearablesBuilder` wires the visuals; `RemovePPE` (HUD Reset) strips everything.

```csharp
UnityEvent onPPEWorn
event Action PPEWornChanged
PPESetModel Set
bool PPEWorn
bool IsWorn(PPEPiece p)
string MissingSummary()
void Don(PPEPiece piece)
void DonCoat()
void DonGoggles()
void DonGloves()
void DonPPE()
void RemovePPE()
void BindVisuals(GameObject[] coat, GameObject[] goggles, GameObject[] gloves)
```

### `PPEDonOnSelect` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/PPEDonOnSelect.cs`</sub>

Forwards an XR select on a locker PPE item (coat display / goggles / gloves) to `PPEController.Don(piece)` — each piece is donned individually (user 2026-07-10). Attach next to an XRSimpleInteractable; `PPEWearablesBuilder` wires these.

```csharp
void Bind(PPEController c, PPEPiece p)
```

### `PPEPiece` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/PPESetModel.cs`</sub>

The three personal-protective-equipment pieces (user 2026-07-10: goggles + gloves are required alongside the coat before experimenting).

### `PPESetModel` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/PPESetModel.cs`</sub>

Pure PPE-worn state (no Unity types — edit-mode testable). The PPEController MonoBehaviour drives visuals/audio from this.

```csharp
bool IsWorn(PPEPiece p)
bool AllWorn
int WornCount
bool Don(PPEPiece p)
bool Clear()
string MissingSummary()
```

### `SaltBurn` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/SaltBurn.cs`</sub>

```csharp
float burnDuration
ParticleSystem flame
```

### `SpoonSaltController` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/SpoonSaltController.cs`</sub>

```csharp
GameObject[] saltVisuals
```

### `WearableReseat` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/WearableReseat.cs`</sub>

Restores the PPE locker displays (lab coat / goggles / gloves) to their original pegs on demand (user 2026-07-10: the lab coat went missing after restarting from the lab tour, so campaign couldn't be entered). Snapshots each display's local pose + active state at scene start; `Reseat()` puts them back AND strips any worn PPE, giving a clean, dressable locker every time the player is asked to gear up (gate CoatPrompt) or restarts (ResetToEntrance).

```csharp
static WearableReseat Instance
```

### `Snap` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Safety/WearableReseat.cs`</sub>

```csharp
void Bind(PPEController controller, string[] names)
void Reseat()
```

## Audio

`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/`

### `AudioCategory` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/AudioService.cs`</sub>

Audio mixer categories. Volume sliders in Settings map 1:1 to these.

### `VolumeUtil` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/AudioService.cs`</sub>

Pure volume maths — a perceptual linear(0..1)→decibel curve for an AudioMixer exposed parameter. Kept separate so it is unit-testable without a mixer asset.

```csharp
const float MinDb
static float LinearToDb(float linear01)
```

### `AudioService` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/AudioService.cs`</sub>

One-stop audio playback + volume control. Holds a per-category AudioSource and a SoundBank; gameplay calls Play("key") / PlayAt(...) and sets category volumes (persisted to PlayerPrefs, and pushed to an optional AudioMixer's exposed "<Category>Volume" params). Clips are assigned in the SoundBank later — the whole service works (as silent no-ops) with zero audio assets, so it can ship now.

```csharp
static AudioService Instance
static float JitteredPitch(float amount, float rand01)
static bool PitchVaries(string key)
static void TryPlay(string key)
SoundBank.Entry EntryOf(string key)
AudioSource AmbientSource
AudioSource MusicSource
float VolumeOf(AudioCategory c)
void SetVolume(AudioCategory c, float linear01)
void LoadVolumes()
void Play(string key)
void PlayAt(string key, Vector3 pos)
void PlayAt3D(string key, Vector3 pos, float volumeScale
static void TryPlayAt(string key, Vector3 pos, float volumeScale
```

### `DialogueDucker` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/DialogueDucker.cs`</sub>

Ducks the looping ambient + music beds while ANY NPC is speaking, so dialogue reads clearly, then eases them back afterward (user 2026-07-10 UX pass). Ref-counts speakers so overlapping lines (Pharmee + Dr. Jimenez) hold the dip until both stop. Subscribes to every NPCNarrationController in the scene at Start — no wiring needed. Only touches the source volumes while a duck is active; otherwise leaves them to AudioService / the settings sliders.

```csharp
static float DuckTarget(int speakers, float factor)
int Speakers
```

### `MusicDucker` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/MusicDucker.cs`</sub>

Pulls the background music down while an NPC is speaking, so dialogue is always clearly audible over it (user 2026-07-27: "reduce the bg music so the player can hear things clearly"), then eases it back afterwards. Ducks FAST and releases SLOWLY — the standard broadcast shape. A quick duck means the first syllable is never buried; a slow release stops the music pumping up and down between two lines of the same conversation.

```csharp
float attackPerSecond
float releasePerSecond
void Bind(AudioSource src)
static float TargetVolume(float baseVolume, float duckTo, bool speaking)
```

### `MusicSpeaker` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/MusicSpeaker.cs`</sub>

A physical music speaker in the lab (user 2026-07-10): a 3D positional source standing in a corner that plays a PLAYLIST of background tracks — louder as you approach it (logarithmic rolloff), quieter across the room. Its volume also smoothly fades in/out with the screen fade, so moving between the menu room and the lab crossfades the music instead of hard-cutting it. Thin MonoBehaviour: playlist advance + fade envelope are pure/testable; the AudioSource is built at runtime so the clip list can be swapped by a builder.

```csharp
bool IsPlaying
float CurrentGain
void Configure(AudioClip[] clips, float volume, float minD, float maxD)
static int NextIndex(int current, int count, bool shuffle, float rand01)
```

### `NpcFootsteps` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/NpcFootsteps.cs`</sub>

Subtle positional footsteps for a walking NPC (user 2026-07-10: Dr. Jimenez). Tracks its own transform's horizontal movement and plays a quiet 3D footstep at its feet once per stride — so his roaming reads audibly but stays background (distance rolloff keeps it soft across the room). Reuses the shared StrideMath + the SoundBank footstep clip at a lowered, own-source volume.

### `PlaySoundOnEnable` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/PlaySoundOnEnable.cs`</sub>

Plays a SoundBank key through the AudioService when the scene starts — used for looping beds (menu music, lab ambient). No-op if there's no AudioService/clip.

```csharp
void SetKey(string k)
void Play()
```

### `ProximityHum` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/ProximityHum.cs`</sub>

Positional machine hum (user 2026-07-10: "subtle ac machine like music for the ac assets where it goes a bit loud as we get near"). Builds its own looping 3D AudioSource from a SoundBank key — quiet across the room, louder up close via a logarithmic rolloff. Attach to each AC unit (LabAudioBuilder wires them); no-ops silently when the clip isn't supplied yet.

```csharp
bool IsHumming
void Bind(string key, float vol)
```

### `RobotVocoder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/RobotVocoder.cs`</sub>

A vocoder attacks the source instead. It splits the voice into N frequency bands and measures only the ENERGY ENVELOPE of each — that envelope is what carries the words, and it contains no pitch information at all. Those envelopes are then imposed on a SYNTHETIC carrier at a fixed pitch. The consonants and vowels survive; the vocal cords are thrown away and replaced by an oscillator. That is the difference between "human with an effect" and "a machine talking". Keeping her FEMALE: the carrier pitch is the voice's new pitch, so a carrier in the 180-260 Hz range reads female while staying perfectly monotone — and monotone is a large part of what reads as robotic. Unvoiced sounds (s, f, sh, t) contain no pitch, so a pure tonal carrier turns them to mush. The carrier therefore blends in noise, which is what restores intelligibility on sibilants.

```csharp
const int MaxBands
const int MaxChannels
int Bands
static float BandCenter(int i, int bands, float lowHz, float highHz)
static float EnvelopeCoeff(float ms, int sampleRate)
void Configure(int bands, int channels, int sampleRate, float lowHz, float highHz, float q, float envMs)
void Reset()
float Process(int channel, float voice, float carrier)
```

### `RobotVoiceFx` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/RobotVoiceFx.cs`</sub>

so nobody re-derives it: • Heavy band-limiting -> "muffled". Fixed by opening the low-pass to 11 kHz and adding the presence lift; those two ARE still in use. • Decimation + comb   -> technically more machine-like, but the verdict was "sounds so human" — they recolour timbre without touching pitch contour. • Vocoder             -> the textbook robot technique (rebuilds the words on a synthetic monotone carrier, discarding the vocal cords entirely) and the verdict was "so much worse". So: the strongest-on-paper techniques lost to the simplest one. Do not swap the character back without asking — every alternative here has already been heard and rejected. Everything stays blended enough to keep the words legible: this is a teaching game and Pharmee explains procedure.

```csharp
RobotVoiceProfile profile
bool active
float VocoderMix
float CarrierHz
float CarrierNoise
float VocoderBands
float VocoderQ
float Downsample
float CombMs
float CombFeedback
float CombMix
float CrushBits

### `RobotVoiceProfile` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/RobotVoiceProfile.cs`</sub>

component. So you can tune by ear in a live session and keep what you land on. ⭐ THE CHOSEN CHARACTER (user 2026-07-28, after hearing all the alternatives): RING MODULATION at a LOW carrier, blended with dry signal. The user describes it as "speaking against an electric fan" and WANTS that — just not too strong. This was arrived at by elimination, so do not "improve" it away: • Heavier band-limiting  -> "muffled"           (rejected) • Decimation + comb      -> "sounds so human"   (rejected — it recolours timbre but leaves the human pitch contour) • Full VOCODER           -> "so much worse"     (rejected outright, even though it is the textbook robot technique) The vocoder, decimation and comb code all still exist and are simply switched off here. Turning them back on is a values change, not a code change — but ask first, because every one of them has already been auditioned and refused.

```csharp
bool active
```

### `SoundBank` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/SoundBank.cs`</sub>

Named clip lookup so gameplay code triggers sounds by key (e.g. "pour", "glass-shatter", "pharmee-warn") and the actual AudioClips are assigned in the asset later — no code change when the audio pass lands. Entries with a null clip are valid placeholders (AudioService no-ops on them).

### `Entry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/SoundBank.cs`</sub>

```csharp
List<Entry> entries
Entry Get(string key)
bool HasClip(string key)
static readonly string[] ExpectedKeys
```

### `SpeakerLedBlink` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/SpeakerLedBlink.cs`</sub>

Makes the lab speaker cabinet's power LED blink like a real machine's standby light (user 2026-07-19): a crisp bright pulse with a long dark gap, rather than the flat always-on emissive it used to be. Driven through a MaterialPropertyBlock so the shared SpeakerLED material is never instanced (edit-mode safe). Thin MonoBehaviour: the envelope is a pure static function; the renderer is bound through Bind() because AddComponent doesn't fire Awake in edit mode.

```csharp
float CurrentLevel
void Bind(Color c, float cyclePeriod, float lit, float peak)
static float Level01(float t, float period, float onFraction, float edgeSeconds, float dimLevel)
```

### `VoiceSpeaker` <sub>enum</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/VoiceBank.cs`</sub>

### `VoiceBank` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/VoiceBank.cs`</sub>

Voice-over clip lookup (user 2026-07-10: Pharmee + Dr. Jimenez must SPEAK their lines). Keyed by speaker + the normalised-text hash (VoiceLineId), so no line/SO schema changes anywhere — a missing clip simply falls back to the existing blip + typewriter. Rebuilt from Audio/Voice/<speaker>/<id>.mp3 by Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Voice ▸ Import & Wire Voice Clips.

### `Entry` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/VoiceBank.cs`</sub>

```csharp
List<Entry> entries
AudioClip Get(VoiceSpeaker speaker, string id)
void Rebuild()
```

### `VoiceLineId` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/VoiceBank.cs`</sub>

Stable line-id: FNV-1a 64-bit over the whitespace-normalised subtitle text. The generation script names files by this id, so a changed line regenerates exactly one clip and stale clips simply stop matching.

### `VoiceCorpus` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Audio/VoiceCorpus.cs`</sub>

Every code-authored NPC line, with its speaker — the voice-over corpus (user 2026-07-10: both NPCs must speak). The manifest exporter adds the cutscene SO beats on top (assets aren't reachable from runtime code). Numbers were deliberately kept OUT of spoken lines (grade bands, finite unlock variants), so this enumeration is exhaustive and finite.

### `AlignExperimentStages` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/AlignExperimentStages.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): experiments spawn their stations/vessels/labels/ waypoints as children of DynamicStage (and Methane uses MethaneStage), both authored at the ORIGINAL center-table spot. When the user moved the whole workspace table into the room, the stages stayed put — so experiment content (incl. the coloured test watch-glasses the user saw as "pads", the stale name tags, and the waypoint) appeared where the table USED to be. This shifts both stages by the table's horizontal delta so all spawns land on the moved table. Idempotent (absolute set from the current table position). Re-run after any further table move.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `AtmosphereBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/AtmosphereBuilder.cs`</sub>

Places the ambient atmosphere emitters (user 2026-07-10): cool vapour sinking from the AC unit + a faint haze layer near the floor and ceiling. Low-density on purpose (Quest overdraw). Door cold-air is code-hooked in DoorOpener, not here. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Atmosphere VFX (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `ButtonSoundsBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ButtonSoundsBuilder.cs`</sub>

Adds UiButtonSounds (hover blip + click) to every UI Button in the OPEN scene (user 2026-07-10). Run it once per scene — MainMenu (cube room) and SampleScene (HUD / choice panels / settings / grade / post-lab). Idempotent. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Wire Button Sounds (edit mode).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `CenterTableBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/CenterTableBuilder.cs`</sub>

Merge Center Tables (user 2026-07-10: "remove the other table; make the current one one single wide table, placed at the center, now in landscape"). The experiment layouts bake WORLD positions on the left island, so this is a one-time atomic migration: 1. discover both islands geometrically (raycast under the baked positions and at their x-mirror; climb to the Environment child), 2. deactivate the right island (+ its sink follows to the new short end), 3. rigid-remap the left island 90° to the lab centre (landscape), 4. apply the SAME remap to every layout-SO position and every in-footprint scene prop (methane stage children, loose items, proctor points), 5. verify every remapped position still raycasts onto a deck. Re-run safe: once the layouts no longer sit on the old left-island footprint, the guard aborts before touching anything. Run Re-Home Scene Items after.

```csharp
static void Merge()
```

### `ChemHazardFlagAudit` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ChemHazardFlagAudit.cs`</sub>

Stamps the HazardousMix flags (isOxidizer / isConcentratedAcid) onto every ChemicalData asset from the pure HazardFlags name rules, and ensures the Chem_RuinedMixture SO (the dark sludge an overheated batch turns into) exists and is registered in the SceneAssetLibrary. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Audit()
static ChemicalData EnsureRuinedMixture()
```

### `ChemicalStateAudit` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ChemicalStateAudit.cs`</sub>

W5.12 reagent-nature audit (user: "double check the reagents if all by nature are really liquid and needed to be scooped"). Dumps every ChemicalData's state/flags to Temp/chemical-state-audit.md and flags chemicals that are solids in their common lab form but are marked Liquid (manuscript solutions like "10% NaOH" are correctly liquid — only pure solids that get weighed/scooped are suspects).

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `CompactHudBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/CompactHudBuilder.cs`</sub>

Compact VR HUD layout (user 2026-07-11): the timer + title move OUT of the centre and merge into the Progress pill on the LEFT (small, stacked); the top cluster tucks to the top edge; the three Settings/Restart/Quit buttons collapse behind ONE hamburger icon that opens a vertical dropdown; and Pharmee's bottom dialogue bar is raised so it's fully in view. Idempotent — re-run after tuning the constants below. Operates on the open scene's HudRig (SampleScene only).

```csharp
static void Rebuild()
```

### `DemoModeBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DemoModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Demo Mode scene wiring (user 2026-07-10). Three menus: • Build Demo Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a config-gated "Demo Mode" button wired to MainMenuController.OnDemoLaboratory. • Build Demo HUD — SampleScene: a Skip Step / Finish Experiment / Auto-Answer Quiz row under the HUD's top-right cluster, driven by DemoHudController. • Demo Enabled (persistent override) — toggles persistentDataPath/demo-config.json for in-editor testing (the shipped StreamingAssets default stays false). All idempotent.

```csharp
static void BuildMenuButton()
static void BuildDemoHud()
static void ToggleOverride()
static bool ToggleOverrideValidate()
```

### `DevCapture` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DevCapture.cs`</sub>

Dev-only capture bridge: renders a one-off camera to a PNG on disk so out-of-editor tooling can see the scene (the MCP scene-preview capture is broken on this machine). Pose/output come from Temp/dev-capture-request.json when present; defaults to the player spawn head pose.

### `Request` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DevCapture.cs`</sub>

```csharp
const string RequestPath
static void Capture()
```

### `DistillationApparatusWiring` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DistillationApparatusWiring.cs`</sub>

W5.12: wires the distillation-completion apparatus into the game — the 6 AI-generated pieces (Condenser, RubberStopper, DeliveryTube, WaterBath, UtilityClamp, Aspirator) plus the 3 that existed only as raw models (Pipette, Thermometer, FlorenceFlask). Each is prefabbed if needed, registered in the SceneAssetLibrary, and one instance is spawned + fully wired + placed in a tidy row beside the distilling flask (the user then nudges + re-homes). Idempotent. Size/physics/breakage live in the code tables (RealSizes/PhysicsProfiles/Mishandling).

### `Spec` <sub>struct</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DistillationApparatusWiring.cs`</sub>

```csharp
static void Wire()
```

### `DistillingFlaskGlass` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/DistillingFlaskGlass.cs`</sub>

W5.12: the DistillingFlask model (glTFast .glb) imported with a bare grey metallic material, so it read as a chrome flask instead of glass. This swaps every mesh on the scene flask (and its prefab) to the SAME borosilicate glass materials the ChemLab beakers use, so it matches the rest of the glassware. Idempotent; run from SampleScene edit mode.

```csharp
static void Upgrade()
```

### `EndProductGateBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/EndProductGateBuilder.cs`</sub>

A ready-made GOAL destroys the experiment (user 2026-07-11 / 2026-07-16) — attaches EndProductVisibility to both storage roots and binds the runner, so each product bottle SetActive(false)s WHILE ITS OWN MODULE RUNS. The gate is per-EXPERIMENT, not per-chemical: Ethanol, Acetone and Benzoic Acid are each some module's goal AND a manuscript-listed reagent for others, so a global hide stripped Exp 2 (which runs before Exp 3/6) of reagents it needs. The four PURE products were deleted from the shelf instead — no bottle, nothing to gate. See EndProductVisibility. Idempotent; safe to re-run after any storage rework.

```csharp
static void Wire()
```

### `EndProductShelfStocker` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/EndProductShelfStocker.cs`</sub>

Acetanilide · Benzamide · Chloroform · Wine are named as a reagent by NO manuscript procedure — their own chemical tests consume the product the player just made (Exp 5's "place 1 gram of acetanilide in a test tube" is testing YOUR synthesis). They are never inputs to anything, so they are simply absent rather than gated. Caffeine went with its dropped module. Ethanol · Acetone · Benzoic Acid are the exception: each is some module's goal AND a manuscript-listed reagent for others (Ethanol → Exp 2, 6; Acetone → Exp 2, 7; Benzoic Acid → Exp 4). They stock as ordinary RAW reagents via RawReagentCatalog / ReagentCabinetBuilder, and EndProductVisibility hides each ONLY while its own module is running — see that class. Run order after this: Generate Reagent Labels → Wire End-Product Gate → Wire Shelf Pourers → Re-Home Scene Items (Adopt Current).

```csharp
static void Stock()
```

### `EntranceSealBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/EntranceSealBuilder.cs`</sub>

Seals the skybox seams the user reported at BOTH entrances (front corridor door + interior lab door, 2026-07-10). Each doorway's frame doesn't quite meet the surrounding wall, so the skybox shows through thin cracks at the jambs/lintel. This wraps each doorway with opaque trim strips (top lintel + two jambs) centred on the wall plane and standing slightly proud on both faces, so the seam is covered whether viewed from the corridor or the lab. Reuses GapSealWall's dark material for a consistent look; re-runnable. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Seal Entrance Gaps (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `FixTripodCollider` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/FixTripodCollider.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the tripod is a STAND — the burner goes underneath, wire gauze + flask on top. But it was given a single CONVEX hull collider (required for a dynamic/grabbable body), which fills the open frame so nothing fits below. A tripod can't be both grabbable-dynamic AND hollow. This makes it a KINEMATIC stand with a NON-CONVEX mesh collider that matches the real open legs+ring, so the burner fits underneath and items rest on top. Still grabbable (moves while held), but it stays where you drop it instead of tumbling. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `FixtureTools` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/FixtureTools.cs`</sub>

Edit-mode helper (user 2026-07-11: "let me manually reposition the sinks, speaker, tables and shelves in the editor"). Two blockers were stopping Scene-view clicks: 1. The Environment furniture (tables, wall cabinets, wash-table sinks) had PICKING DISABLED (the pointer toggle in the Hierarchy) — same reason the stools couldn't be clicked. 2. Some fixtures (the LabSpeaker, and the shelf ROOTS that sit at the origin with their meshes parented elsewhere) had no click target, so a click selected a child prop instead of the movable unit. This re-enables picking on every fixture, ensures a click collider where one is missing, and selects them all so they show in the Hierarchy — click the one you want in the Scene view and move it with the gizmo (W), then Ctrl-S. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Select Movable Furniture (edit mode).

```csharp
static void SelectFurniture()
```

### `FumeHoodSwap` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/FumeHoodSwap.cs`</sub>

Swaps the sealed Tripo fume-hood model for the regenerated OPEN-SASH, hollow-chamber one (user 2026-07-18: "even if you have a sliding there, it is not hollow inside"). Idempotent: • deactivates the old FumeHoodModel (kept in the scene for hand-deletion, per the user's delete-by-hand preference), • mounts Art/Generated/Refs/FumeHoodOpen.prefab under FumeHood_StandIn, height-normalised to the house 2.35 m, • re-fits the WorkVolume trigger into the new chamber (upper-front region — hand-tune afterwards, the wire box is visible when selected), • rebuilds the HoodShell walls from the refit volume (front stays open).

```csharp
static void Swap()
```

### `GrabMovementTools` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/GrabMovementTools.cs`</sub>

Applies the GrabTuning velocity-tracked profile to every grabbable so held items collide with the world (user 2026-07-10: props could be pushed through walls/floor). Covers the SceneAssetLibrary prefabs (persisted) AND every XRGrabInteractable in the open scene(s) (catches instance overrides, stools, shelf bottles). Idempotent — re-running reports 0 changes.

```csharp
static void Wire()
```

### `GradeBackButtonBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/GradeBackButtonBuilder.cs`</sub>

W5.9: the fail path used to trap the player in a Retry-only loop — this wires a "Complete Experiment" button onto the grade screen (shown only on FAIL, where Continue is hidden — they share the slot) that ends the attempt and returns the player to the entrance, where any unlocked experiment can be picked. Label renamed from "Choose Another" (user 2026-07-15). Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Wire()
```

### `HandVisualsBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HandVisualsBuilder.cs`</sub>

v4 (user 2026-07-11): controllers are REPLACED by skinned hands — XR Hands sample meshes (Art/Hands/LeftHand.fbx + RightHand.fbx, real finger bones). Two skins: bare (HandSkin.mat) / nitrile blue (HandNitrile.mat) driven by the PPE gloves state; two poses: free / grab (finger curl while selecting) driven by HandPoseController. Retires the old procedural mittens, HandVisualKeeper AND the FPGlove_* first-person glove clones (PPE visuals rebound to the mirror gloves only — first-person gloving is now the material swap). Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Hand Visuals — run per scene, edit mode.

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `HeadsetPlayModeToggle` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HeadsetPlayModeToggle.cs`</sub>

One-click switch for editor Play mode's XR init on the Standalone (PC) target — the setting buried under Project Settings ▸ XR Plug-in Management ▸ (per target) "Initialize XR on Startup". • ON  → pressing Play brings up OpenXR, so a Quest connected via Quest Link / Air Link drives the headset. Use this to test in the headset. • OFF → Play never touches OpenXR, so the headset-less PC dev loop (XR Device Simulator + keyboard DevExperimentDriver) is safe. Leaving it ON with NO headset connected can stall Play mode. Android is left untouched (the APK always auto-inits on the device).

### `HideStationPads` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HideStationPads.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the hand-built Methane station pads still render as coloured cubes on the table — the DynamicStage builder hides its own pads (padMr.enabled = false, W5.8) but the authored Station_* objects were missed. The pads are purely cosmetic: the trigger COLLIDER + sensors that detect each step stay, and the guides/labels tell the player where to act — so the cube mesh just clutters the view. This disables the MeshRenderer on every Station_* pad while leaving all functionality intact. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `HoverInfoBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/HoverInfoBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the hover-inspector info card + wires the raycasting HoverInspector into SampleScene (user 2026-07-10). Point the right-hand ray (or gaze) at a reagent, a piece of apparatus or an NPC and a smoothly-animated card names it and explains what it is / how to use it. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Hover Info Panel (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `IloBeatInjector` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/IloBeatInjector.cs`</sub>

Injects each experiment's ILO beats into its Intro cutscene (user 2026-07-10: Pharmee states the learning outcomes in the opening dialogue). Beats slot in after the greeting beat: a lead-in, then one beat per objective (verbatim Appendix C copy from IloCopy). Idempotent — the lead-in text is the marker.

```csharp
static readonly (string moduleId, string prefix)[] Modules
static void Inject()
static int InjectInto(CutsceneData data, string moduleId)
```

### `JimenezHudPortraitBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/JimenezHudPortraitBuilder.cs`</sub>

Gives Dr. Jimenez a HUD presence equal to Pharmee's (user 2026-07-19: "let's make dr jimenez same as pharmee that appears in our HUD as well. so we'll need to create an icon image for dr. jimenez as well"). Two jobs, both idempotent: 1. RENDER his portrait from his own rigged model — a transparent-background headshot framed on the humanoid Head bone. No AI generation (so no credits, and no risk of a portrait that looks like a different person): the icon IS the character the player meets. → Art/UI/jimenez_icon.png, imported with pharmee_icon.png's settings (Sprite/Single, alpha, no mips). 2. WIRE the HudDialogueBar for two speakers: the existing DialogueBar Portrait Image + Pharmee's icon as the primary channel, and Jimenez's narration + name + new icon as an extra channel. Before this his lines only ever appeared in his own world bubble — the HUD bar showed nothing.

### `LabAlarmBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabAlarmBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the lab's hazard-alarm fixture (manuscript: "flashing lights, warning messages, alarm beeps"): a small red ceiling box + one red point light + LabAlarm, centred over the lab. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `LabLightingBake` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabLightingBake.cs`</sub>

is the whole reason it is the right tool on a Quest. The three steps that have to happen in THIS order, because each depends on the last: 1. Lightmap UVs. A mesh with no UV2 cannot receive a lightmap. 36 of the project's 107 models lacked them, including the entire room shell (Wall, Floor, Ceiling_2, the tables). Anything still missing UV2 after the import pass is set to receive from LIGHT PROBES instead, so it still occludes and bounces without a broken lightmap. 2. Static flags, filtered HARD. A grabbable baked into a lightmap carries its baked shadow around the room in your hand, so anything with a Rigidbody, an XRGrabInteractable, a DropRespawn or a LabItem is excluded, as is everything the stage builder spawns. 3. Light modes. Realtime lights contribute nothing to a bake. Tools > PharmaSynth > Prepare Lab Lighting Bake  - steps 1-3, no bake (fast, inspectable) Tools > PharmaSynth > 

```csharp
static void Prepare()

```

### `LabLightingBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabLightingBuilder.cs`</sub>

Brightens the lab so it reads as a well-lit laboratory (user 2026-07-10: "a lab must be well-lit, currently our lab-room is dim"). Quest-friendly recipe — NO extra shadow-casting lights: 1. The 16 ceiling `Light (n)` fixture meshes get a white EMISSIVE panel material (they were unlit gray boxes). 2. Flat ambient raised from the dark skybox gray (0.21) to a bright neutral. 3. A small grid of shadowless point lights (`LabLights` group, re-runnable) fills the room — 6 lights, wide range, warm-white, no shadows (URP per-object cap safe). 4. The directional key light keeps shadows but drops a touch so it doesn't blow out. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Brighten Lab Lighting (run in SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `LabNpcPolishBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabNpcPolishBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the 2026-07-10 NPC/audio polish batch into SampleScene: 1. Pharmee expressions — PharmeeFace re-pointed at the robot's EYES + MOUTH meshes (was Ears_Black_Matt_0), default-happy; PharmeeMood resets the face after every line; the gatekeeper's faceBehaviour drives gate moods. 2. Dr. Jimenez proctor roaming — ProctorRoamer + observation points at the reagent shelf, equipment shelf, dynamic stage and fume hood. 3. AC proximity hum — ProximityHum on the air-con / vent assets (falls back to the fume hood if no AC mesh exists). Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Wire NPC Polish (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `LabProbeBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabProbeBuilder.cs`</sub>

blending AND box projection switched on - the features were paid for with nothing to feed them. Two consequences the player sees constantly: * Every glass material in the ChemLab pack sets _EnvironmentReflections = 1, so with no probe they all sampled the DEFAULT reflection - the built-in procedural outdoor sky - inside a sealed windowless room. That is why beakers and flasks read as pale plastic. * Every dynamic object (all grabbable glassware, held items, Pharmee, Dr. Jimenez) was lit by flat ambient alone, so a beaker was lit identically under a closed cabinet and directly beneath a lamp. Nothing in the room grounded anything. Probe placement is DERIVED from the room's own renderer bounds rather than hard-coded, so it survives the furniture moves the user makes through Select Movable Furniture.

### `LabRenderTuner` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabRenderTuner.cs`</sub>

* MSAA was 1 (off). On the Adreno tile GPU 4x resolves in tile memory and is close to free, and this scene is nothing but thin edges - tube rims, glass rods, rack rails. It is the largest per-pixel quality gain available. * HDR was off, so emission above 1.0 just clamped: the 16 emissive ceiling panels could never read as LIGHTS, only as white paint, and tonemapping had no range to work with. * Ambient was FLAT grey 0.45 - identical from every direction, so nothing in the room had any vertical shading and the whole space read as one plane of grey. * The skybox was the built-in PROCEDURAL SKY, in a sealed windowless room, feeding ambient and every reflection an outdoor gradient. Vignette is deliberately DISABLED rather than tuned down: it was active at template strength and would have switched on the moment post was enabled, and a vignette in a headset reads as a dirty lens rather than as

### `LabSurfaceTextureForge` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabSurfaceTextureForge.cs`</sub>

Generates the lab's MISSING surface textures (user 2026-08-28: "improve the textures to make it an aesthetic lab"; free-authoring route chosen, so no Unity AI credits are spent). The Laboratory pack left the two largest surfaces in the player's view with no albedo at all - Wall_0/Wall_1 carry a normal map and nothing else, and Ceiling_2 carries no maps whatsoever. A featureless white plane is exactly what makes the room read as an untextured grey box, and it is worst on the ceiling, which a seated VR player looks straight up into. Everything here is drawn in code and written to PNG - the same approach LabelForge already uses for reagent labels: deterministic, re-runnable, diffable, and free. All noise wraps, so the maps tile seamlessly. Tools > PharmaSynth > Generate Lab Surface Textures (edit mode, idempotent, re-runnable).

```csharp

### `LabSurfaceTuner` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabSurfaceTuner.cs`</sub>

single most obviously wrong thing in the room. * The four vessel materials the player handles constantly - beaker 100/500, Erlenmeyer, graduated cylinder - sat at smoothness 0. Glass with NO specular and NO reflection is why they read as pale plastic blobs. The same pack ships CORRECT glass values on GlassMat/GlassInnerMat/GlassOuterMat (0.92-0.95), so the right answer was already sitting next to the wrong one. * Several non-metals sat at metallic 0 + smoothness 1 - a physically impossible "non-metal mirror" that produces a hard white specular blob instead of a highlight. Every value here is a judgement about what the surface IS, so they live in one table rather than being scattered. Suite-pinned (surface:) because a pack reimport or a stray inspector drag restores the bad values silently and pure math cannot see a material regression - the same lesson as the wiped MatchStrikerSurface.

### `LabelForge` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LabelForge.cs`</sub>

Reagent-label compositor (§3, client style pick: MODERN). For every Reagent_* bottle on the shelf: renders LabelBase_Modern + the chemical's name (crisp TMP text — never AI typography) to a PNG, builds a material, and mounts a label quad on the bottle facing the aisle. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Generate Reagent Labels — idempotent, re-run anytime.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `LayoutTidy` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LayoutTidy.cs`</sub>

Re-seats every experiment layout onto the LayoutTidyMath zoning grid (W5.8: clean center table — stations across the back, vessels center-front, reagents right, tools left; the front strip stays free for the rack and spares). Deterministic + idempotent; also structurally removes the two historical clamped overlaps at (1.38, −3.88) in Acetone and Benzamide. Run AFTER `Apply W5.8 Verb Data` so new stations/props get slots too.

```csharp
static void Run()
static int Tidy(ExperimentLayout layout)
```

### `LockMyLayout` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/LockMyLayout.cs`</sub>

One-click self-service layout lock (user 2026-07-13: "after I move or duplicate assets I just want one button"). Does everything needed to make a hand-arranged workspace permanent — with NO rebuilding, so it can never reset placements: 1. Tidy duplicate names  — "Beaker (1)" → "Beaker_100mL_2", + full interaction wiring for any raw duplicate that was missing it. 2. Re-home every item     — current transform becomes its respawn home (moved originals AND duplicates), so nothing snaps back in Play. 3. Save the scene. Run this after ANY manual arrangement; then it's locked with no need to ping Claude. Purely additive — spawns/destroys nothing.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `ManualLayoutAdopter` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ManualLayoutAdopter.cs`</sub>

W5.12: the user hand-placed the whole workspace (kits, duplicates, reagent shelf, spawn point) — this adopts that layout as canonical in ONE run: 1. renames editor duplicates ("Beaker_100mL (1)") to clean unique names + display names, and gives them the full interaction wiring; 2. re-points the teleport target (FrontDoorSpawn) at the rig's current pose — the user moved the avatar to the new spawn spot; 3. re-homes every DropRespawn to its current transform; 4. creates + registers the missing DistillingFlask (the model existed only as an unimported .glb — that's why it couldn't be found) and parks it beside a graduated cylinder; 5. drops a ManualLayout_W512 marker that guards the shelf/kits builders from clobbering the hand layout on a re-run. Idempotent; run from SampleScene in edit mode.

```csharp

### `MaterialsGuideGenerator` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MaterialsGuideGenerator.cs`</sub>

Fills every module's MATERIALS guide (the watch-panel header, user 2026-07-17: "display all materials needed first, from reagents and apparatus… just there as a guide so the players can assemble them before they even proceed"). REAGENTS are DERIVED from the module's layout bindings — the ground truth of what the experiment actually consumes — with totals summed per chemical, so the guide can never drift from the tasks. Units follow the game's own convention (1 squeeze = 1 ml): liquids read "N ml", solids/powders "N g". APPARATUS is AUTHORED here per module, from the PROCEDURES — never from the manuscript's own apparatus lists, which are documented as defective (experiments-reference §Apparatus: "stage from the PROCEDURE, never the list"). Idempotent: re-run after any layout change.

### `MenuAutoRun` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MenuAutoRun.cs`</sub>

Menu-execution twin of SelfTestAutoRun, for when the MCP bridge is down: if Logs/menu-autorun-request.txt exists, execute each listed line in order, capture the console output, write it to Logs/menu-autorun-result.txt, and consume the request. (Logs/, NOT Temp/ — Unity wipes Temp at editor startup, which destroys any request queued while the editor was closed.) Line forms: Tools/PharmaSynth/Wire Shelf Pourers      — execute that menu item OPEN Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity      — open that scene first (single mode) CAPTURE px py pz yaw pitch out.png        — DevCapture from that pose to the given path (relative to project) # comment                                 — ignored Runs on the next domain reload in an interactive editor, or via Unity.exe -batchmode -quit -projectPath <proj> -executeMethod MenuAutoRun.RunNow Harmless when no request file is present.

Builds the futuristic CUBE SPAWN ROOM in the MainMenu scene (user 2026-07-10): a fully-enclosed, solid, dark room with cyan/teal emissive trim, a couple of soft lights and a glowing floor launch-pad under the menu panel. Sealed on all six sides so no skybox leaks. Re-runnable and idempotent — deletes the prior "MenuCubeRoom" and rebuilds it, and hides the old open "MenuRoom" dressing. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Menu Cube Room. Run with the MainMenu scene open.

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `MethaneAnchors` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneAnchors.cs`</sub>

Creates the draggable placement anchors the verbs read (user 2026-07-14: "can I drag these to the specific parts?"). After running this, each match/burner gets a "FlameAnchor" child and each scoopula/spatula a "ScoopAnchor" child, dropped at a best-guess spot. SELECT it in the Hierarchy (orange gizmo in the Scene view), drag it onto the exact part — match head, burner mouth, scoop bowl — then run Lock My Layout to bake it. Idempotent: never moves an anchor you've already positioned.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethaneApparatusGrab` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneApparatusGrab.cs`</sub>

Guarantee the methane apparatus is pick-up-able (user 2026-07-15: "I can't pick up the draw tubes"). Normalises every common grab-blocker on the hard-glass tube, collection tube and burner: active, on the Default layer, with an XRGrabInteractable (velocity-tracked + two-handed), a Rigidbody, a live convex collider, and the shelf/respawn policy. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethaneBeakerSwap` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneBeakerSwap.cs`</sub>

Swap the sodium-acetate/soda-lime SOURCE from a sealed amber vial to an OPEN beaker (user 2026-07-14: "since this is scooped not poured, use an open beaker-looking container"). Solids belong in a wide-mouth vessel you can dip a scoop into. Preserves each jar's position + contents + wiring: instantiates Beaker_100mL in place, re-tags it "reagent-jar", refills it with the solid, rebuilds the powder mound (open top → the scoop reaches it), re-labels it, and destroys the old vial. Idempotent (skips jars that are already beakers).

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethaneBenchPermanent` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneBenchPermanent.cs`</sub>

Make the methane bench TOOLS (mortar, pestle, scoopula, spatula) permanent fixtures — usable in BOTH Lab Tour and Campaign, all the time (user 2026-07-14: "the mortar must be usable for both modes all throughout"). They were parented under MethaneStage, which MethaneStageVisibility hides at play-start, so they vanished in Play. This lifts them OUT of the stage (world position preserved), makes sure they're active + rest kinematic (won't fall through the bench), and re-homes them so a Reset keeps them put. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethaneLocationFree` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneLocationFree.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): convert the Methane tutorial to LOCATION-FREE completion. Deletes the 5 fixed Station_* zone objects (no more standing on a pad), and rewires the MethaneApparatusRig to own its TemperatureSim + GasCollection so heat/collect/splint fire by item PROXIMITY anywhere, and prepare-mixture completes by grinding a mortar. Run once. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethanePlaytestFix` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethanePlaytestFix.cs`</sub>

W5.12 playtest fixes (user 2026-07-13): the workspace burners had no BurnerController (couldn't be lit) and NOTHING in the scene was a MatchStrikerSurface (a match couldn't be struck), which blocked the whole heat step; and the Methane reagent jar had no LiquidPhysics so it couldn't be scooped/poured. This wires all three so the location-free Methane rig works: • every Bunsen/Alcohol burner gets BurnerController + MatchStrikerSurface (strike a match on the burner base to light it, then it lights the tube), • any matchbox-like object becomes a striker too, • the reagent jar becomes a scoopable solid (Sodium Acetate). Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethaneRecover` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneRecover.cs`</sub>

Diagnose + recover the methane bench items (user 2026-07-14: "the mortar is still missing from the table where I placed it"). A likely cause: an item was moved AFTER the last Lock My Layout, so its respawn home was stale and a Reset teleported it away (often below the floor). This reports every methane item's position + active state, reactivates + lifts anything that fell, and RE-HOMES them all at their current spot so the next Reset keeps them put.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `MethaneStageVisibilityBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MethaneStageVisibilityBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the MethaneStageVisibility controller (user 2026-07-13: methane set present only in Lab Tour + the Methane attempt). Puts the component on ExperimentSystems (a manager that keeps running while the stage is hidden), binds the MethaneStage + runner + LabTourGuide, and re-hides the stage in the authored scene so it doesn't flash on lab entry. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Wire()
```

### `MusicSpeakerBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/MusicSpeakerBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the corner music speaker in the lab (user 2026-07-10): a floor-standing speaker cabinet in the empty back-right corner that plays the Background_Music/Lab playlist as a 3D positional source (louder as you approach) and fades in/out with the screen fade on menu<->lab transitions. Also disables the old 2D LabMusicPlayer bed and re-points the menu-room music to the user's supplied track. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Lab Music Speaker (SampleScene, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `PPEWearablesBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PPEWearablesBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the per-piece wearable PPE (user 2026-07-10): 1. The locker's goggles + gloves become CLICKABLE (collider + XRSimpleInteractable + PPEDonOnSelect), the coat display forwards Coat, and the legacy don-everything paths are disabled (host donOnSelect off, coat display's old persistent calls cleared). 2. Worn visuals cloned from the locker models onto the mirror avatar's bones (coat→Spine01, goggles→Head, gloves→hand bones — PlayerAvatar layer, mirror-only) and first-person gloves onto the controllers (main-camera visible). 3. All visuals assigned to PPEController's per-piece arrays, initially hidden. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build PPE Wearables (run in SampleScene AFTER Build Player Avatar, edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `PanelConsolidationBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PanelConsolidationBuilder.cs`</sub>

One procedures display (user 2026-07-10): the entrance LabTablet duplicated the wrist holo board, and the wrist mini-panel duplicated the holo header — three surfaces fighting over the same content, with the tablet's fixed rect overflowing into its reaction footer. This menu retires the LabTablet (deactivated, not deleted) and the MiniPanel, and upgrades the holo board to the single panel: status header (ex mini-panel) + focused checklist + the balanced-reaction footer (ex tablet). Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Consolidate()
static void FixHoloScroll()
```

### `PharmaSelfTests` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PharmaSelfTests.cs`</sub>

Re-runnable regression suite for the PharmaSynth engine. Run via menu: Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Run Self-Tests. Consolidates the assertions that were verified incrementally during W2–W3 into one permanent, one-click check. (Kept as an Editor-menu suite rather than an NUnit asmdef to avoid restructuring the runtime assembly; a formal EditMode asmdef migration can layer on later.)

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `PharmeeGestureSim` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PharmeeGestureSim.cs`</sub>

Proves Pharmee's animation set actually MOVES HIM, in edit mode. The suite pins the pure curves (`PharmeeGestureSuite`), but a correct curve reaching a transform that is not bound produces exactly nothing while every assertion stays green. That is the failure this menu exists to catch, and it is the same reason `Simulate Tutorial Guidance` exists rather than another pin: it has to drive real scene objects, and the suite is kept side-effect-free. For each gesture it applies the pose at its peak and measures the ACTUAL degrees and millimetres the scene transforms moved, then restores them. Tools > PharmaSynth > Simulate Pharmee Gestures (edit mode, restores what it touches).

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `PhysicsAudit` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PhysicsAudit.cs`</sub>

Physics-attributes / resting-pose audit (task #78). Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Physics Audit (Report)   — non-destructive scan of the scene apparatus + SceneAssetLibrary prefabs: colliders present/degenerate, Rigidbody settings, profile coverage. Writes Temp/physics-audit.md. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Physics Audit (Drop Test) — drops every library prefab onto a plane 50 m above the lab for 3 simulated seconds (script-mode simulation, all other dynamic rigidbodies frozen for the sweep) and checks it neither tunnels, rolls away, nor balances implausibly.

```csharp
static void Report()
static void FixSceneItems()
static Rigidbody WireSceneItem(GameObject go, string prefabName, ExperimentRunner runner)
static void DropTest()
static string PrefabNameFor(GameObject go)
```

### `PlayFromMenuBootstrap` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlayFromMenuBootstrap.cs`</sub>

Every editor Play starts in the CUBE SPAWN ROOM (user 2026-07-10: "ensure that every start or play, I start at the cuberoom not at the lab right away") — exactly like the built game (MainMenu is build index 0). Uses the editor's play-mode start scene, so whatever scene is OPEN keeps its edits; Play simply boots MainMenu. Toggle off via the menu when a direct lab test is needed (e.g. iterating on stage layout with the DevExperimentDriver).

### `PlayModeSwitch` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlayModeSwitch.cs`</sub>

One-click switch between the two ways to run PharmaSynth in the editor, so you never have to hunt the Hierarchy or Project Settings: • PC Dev Mode — OpenXR auto-init OFF + the "XR Device Simulator" GameObject ENABLED, so W/A/S/D + mouse move the view on the PC with no headset. • Headset Mode — OpenXR auto-init ON + the simulator DISABLED, so a Quest on Quest Link / Air Link drives the view. Each mode fixes BOTH halves (the XR init setting AND the scene's simulator object) and saves, which the old "Headset Play Mode" toggle did not — that one only flipped the init setting, leaving the simulator off, so nothing drove the camera. Menu shows a checkmark for the active mode. Android is left untouched.

### `PlayerAvatarBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/PlayerAvatarBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the mirror-only first-person avatar (user 2026-07-10). Expects a rigged humanoid prefab (Tripo image→3D + Tripo Rigging v1, casual clothes, T-pose) in Art/Generated/Models with "player"/"avatar" in its name — or select it in the Project. Places it under the XR rig, puts it on the PlayerAvatar layer (culled by the main camera, shown by the mirror), and wires an Animation-Rigging IK setup: two-bone IK on each arm (hands→controllers) + a head rotation constraint (head→HMD), driven by PlayerAvatarRig. Raw-bone IK, so NO Humanoid retarget / T-pose calibration. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Player Avatar (run in SampleScene, edit mode).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `QuizNavButtonsBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/QuizNavButtonsBuilder.cs`</sub>

Add "< Back" / "Next >" buttons to the quiz tablet (user 2026-07-15: "so users can review their answers before submitting"). Clones the existing Submit button so styling matches, wires them to PostLabController.PreviousQuestion/NextQuestion, assigns the controller's prevButton/nextButton refs (which grey out at the ends), and makes sure the quiz canvas is XR-ray clickable. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Build()
static float WidthFor(float buttonWidth, float parentWidth)
static float StepFor(float buttonWidth, float parentWidth, float submitOffsetX)
```

### `RawReagentForge` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RawReagentForge.cs`</sub>

Generates the ChemicalData assets for every RawReagentCatalog row that the game doesn't already know (matched by normalised chemicalName), stamps the HazardousMix flags from the shared HazardFlags rules, and registers everything in the SceneAssetLibrary so layouts and the cabinet builder resolve them. Consumable rows (SmallBox/IceBucket) are physical props, not chemicals — no SO is made for them. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Generate()
```

### `ReHomeSceneItems` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReHomeSceneItems.cs`</sub>

Adopts every scene item's CURRENT transform as its DropRespawn home (user 2026-07-10: "I have manually relocated some equipment, please make those their default spawn point"). Without this, manually moved props teleport back to their old serialized homes after ~25 s idle / a kill-Z fall / a reset. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Re-Home Scene Items (Adopt Current) — run in SampleScene edit mode after ANY manual re-arrangement, then save the scene.

```csharp
static void Adopt()
```

### `ReachabilityAudit` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReachabilityAudit.cs`</sub>

Asks the one question the run simulator structurally cannot: a step can be mechanically perfect while the bottle it needs sits inside a closed cabinet or above head height. `SimulatedRun` reaches every object by reference, so it will never notice — only a headset would, which is exactly the cost this is here to avoid. Its input is already built and already verified: `TutorialTargets.Build()` resolves taskId → the objects each step is about, for all 9 modules. So the audit asks, of every object a step needs, "could a player standing in this room actually get to it?" Deliberately GEOMETRIC rather than a navmesh walk. The player has continuous locomotion over the whole lab floor, so "can I stand near it" is nearly always true; what actually goes wrong is height and enclosure. A navmesh would be a week of work to answer a question two raycasts answer.

```csharp
const float HardHigh
const float HardLow
const float Clearance
```

### `Verdict` <sub>enum</sub>

### `ReagentCabinetBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReagentCabinetBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the raw-reagent storage (user 2026-07-10: the manuscript's ~54 materials must exist in the lab): three open shelf units against the wall, stocked from RawReagentCatalog with nature-appropriate labware — reagent bottles, amber bottles for the light-sensitive, powder jars, dropper bottles, consumable boxes (litmus/matches/cotton/filter) and an ice bucket. Every bottle is grabbable, pourable, spill-graded and hover-explained. Chemicals already displayed on the legacy ReagentShelf are skipped. Re-runnable: the ReagentCabinets root is cleared and rebuilt deterministically.

```csharp
static string PrefabFor(RawReagentCatalog.LabwareKind kind)
static void Build()
```

### `RemoveLitSplint` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RemoveLitSplint.cs`</sub>

Delete the wooden splint prop (user 2026-07-15, backed by a manuscript review): "splint" appears NOWHERE in the client manuscript — every combustion/flame test is run with a "lighted matchstick" (Exp 3: "apply a lighted matchstick... blue flame indicates complete combustion"). The methane gas test already fires off a lit Matchstick (MethaneApparatusRig.SplintShouldFire checks Matchstick), so the splint prop is redundant. The method names keep the "splint" wording (suite-pinned); only the prop goes. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `RemovePipette` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RemovePipette.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): drop the modern mechanical pipette — the Dropper (drops) + graduated cylinder (ml) already cover its manuscript role. Removes the scene instance, the SceneAssetLibrary registration, and the generated prefab. The raw MechanicalPipette model pack is left on disk (harmless). Idempotent; safe to run once.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `RemoveVrInappropriateApparatus` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RemoveVrInappropriateApparatus.cs`</sub>

Deletes the SCENE INSTANCES of apparatus that the manuscript lists but that carry no meaningful VR interaction — pure bench scaffolding and passive instruments the game already abstracts (user 2026-07-17: "they should be removed even from the table, but not from the folders just in case"). ⛔ DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED EXCEPTION to the "ALL tools always present" client rule. These six are NOT a decluttering of usable tools — each is either a support rig the zone-free heat model made unnecessary or an instrument whose reading the game shows on-screen. The PREFAB ASSETS stay in the project, so a future experiment that genuinely needs one can re-place it. Do NOT let "Restore All Bench Items" or an all-tools audit re-add them — they are removed on purpose. Justifications live in experiments-reference.md.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `RestoreBenchItems` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RestoreBenchItems.cs`</sub>

Re-activate every bench item that was hidden (client rule 2026-07-15: ALL tools and reagents are present across ALL experiments — nothing is ever hidden or removed per-experiment). Undoes any accidental deactivation. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `RevealExperimentStage` <sub>class</sub>

mode only shown. dont remove any yet, I'll remove it myself. just show all prelims tools we have currently in edit mode as well"). ⛔ DELETES NOTHING. Same intent as RevealMethaneStage: the stage normally only exists at runtime, so there is no way to see what an experiment litters the bench with until you are inside VR. This makes it visible and named. Why the grouping matters: the spawn sources are independent, and only ONE of them is the layout's fault — • LAYOUT VESSELS   — authored per experiment (Exp 2's 20 tubes duplicate the bench) • SpawnRackKit     — a rack + 6 tubes, EVERY module, predates the permanent bench • SpawnSpares      — 2 spare beakers + a flask, EVERY module • StageConsumables — matches + a "Striker" cube at Heat experiments. The cube is redundant: since W5.8 the matchbox itself is the striker. Re-run after a rebuild; the builder clears the stage each time, so it is i

### `RevealMethaneAndWaypoint` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RevealMethaneAndWaypoint.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): reveal the Methane set + the waypoint marker in the editor so the user can hand-align them, and permanently strip the waypoint's yellow ground glow (keep only the arrow). The Methane STATIONS carry the step-detection zones AND are what the waypoint arrow follows, so moving them with the props is how both detection and the arrow get aimed correctly.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `RevealMethaneStage` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RevealMethaneStage.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the Methane tutorial stage is authored inactive (m_IsActive:0) so it stays hidden in the editor. The user wants to review / delete it by hand, so this switches it (and any other hidden methane roots) ON in edit mode and lists what became visible. Runtime is unaffected — ExperimentSceneBuilder still SetActive(moduleId==methane) each build. ⚠ Deleting these breaks Experiment 1 until Methane is rewired to build on the workspace (the splint-pop rig especially is wired to the stage's tube).

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `ReviewCornerBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ReviewCornerBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the post-experiment review corner (user 2026-07-11): a ReviewCornerSpawn marker in front of the PostLabTablet (biased toward Dr. Jimenez's spot) that the gatekeeper fade-teleports the player to for the quiz-review flow, plus the gatekeeper's postLab/examiner refs and the quiz's autoOpen=false (the gate now opens the quiz after Jimenez's briefing). Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `RobotVoiceBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/RobotVoiceBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires Pharmee's robot voice colouring onto HIS narration channel only (2026-07-27). Dr. Jimenez is a human examiner and must stay untouched — the whole point of the two-NPC contrast is that one is a machine and one is not. Ring modulation does the robot work (RobotVoiceFx); Unity's stock filters do the colouring — a band limit so he sounds like he is coming through a speaker grille, and a short chorus for the metallic doubling. All of it is live-tunable in the Inspector during Play, so the character can be dialled in by ear without regenerating a single clip.

```csharp
static void Apply()
static void Remove()
```

### `ScoopSoundWiring` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ScoopSoundWiring.cs`</sub>

Wire the generated solid-material SFX into the SoundBank (user 2026-07-15: "scooping powder still sounds like liquid"). The scoop verb calls the "scoop" and "powder-pour" keys via AudioService.TryPlayFirstAt, which deliberately has NO liquid fallback — so these clips are what make it audible. Clips generated with elevenlabs-sound-effects-v2 into Audio/Generated/. Idempotent: updates the entries in place if they already exist.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `SelfTestAutoRun` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SelfTestAutoRun.cs`</sub>

One-shot self-test runner for when the MCP bridge is down: if Temp/selftest-autorun-request.txt exists after a domain reload, run the suite once, write the console result to Temp/selftest-autorun-result.txt, and consume the request. Harmless when no request file is present.

### `ShelfPourBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/ShelfPourBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the hand-placed reagent bottles for visible pouring (user 2026-07-10: tipping a shelf bottle showed nothing — LiquidPourer only existed on runtime-spawned props). Sweeps every LiquidPhysics under the ReagentShelf (and, once batch H lands, ReagentCabinets) root through ShelfPourWiring.WireBottle, and ensures the persisted particle material asset exists so device builds don't strip the URP particle shader. Idempotent — re-running reports 0 additions.

```csharp
static void Wire()
static Material EnsureFxMaterial()
```

### `SimulateEverything` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SimulateEverything.cs`</sub>

ONE command that plays the whole game and answers one question: is every experiment actually doable right now? (user 2026-09-02: "there are too many experiments and it would take me time to play and find bugs each by each"). It adds no new simulation of its own — `SimulatedRun.Run` and `SimulatedCampaign.Run` were already public and already return structured results. What was missing was a single entry point and a single verdict: before this you clicked 8 Simulate Run items, then Campaign, then two tutorial audits, and read 11 separate log files hoping to spot the one line that mattered. Everything lands in Logs/simulate-everything.txt, worst module FIRST — a report you have to scroll to find the failure in is a report that gets skimmed.

```csharp
static void RunMenu()
```

### `Row` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SimulateEverything.cs`</sub>

### `SimulatedCampaign` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SimulatedCampaign.cs`</sub>

The transcript (Logs/simcampaign.txt) is written as the PLAYER EXPERIENCE: every line Pharmee/Jimenez speaks, every panel prompt, every grade/outro beat — so it can be read as a clueless player and critiqued. SAFETY: progression is recorded to a TEMP save file (Application. temporaryCachePath), never the user's real pharmasynth_pro

```

### `SimulatedMisplay` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SimulatedMisplay.cs`</sub>

Simulates the player who gets it WRONG. Every other simulator plays a flawless run, which answers "does correct play work?". It does not answer the question that actually decides whether nine experiments are doable by a student: **after a mistake, can they still finish?** A contaminated vessel, an out-of-order attempt or an exhausted bottle that quietly makes a run unfinishable looks identical to a clean sim — the perfect path never touches it. Each probe asserts two things, and the second is the important one: the mistake is reported AND the run remains completable afterwards.

```csharp
static void RunMenu()
static List<string> RunAll(StringBuilder log)
```

### `SimulatedRun` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SimulatedRun.cs`</sub>

• correct play being flagged as a mistake (mis-authored bindings) HOW it simulates — the PLAYER PATH, not the plumbing (user 2026-07-17: "do not cheat by programmatically connecting things; you wouldn't see issues"): builder.Build() wires the real scene, runner.StartExperiment() opens the real graph, and every reagent is then TRANSFERRED the way a hand would — drawn out of the actual bench source bottle (PourOut) and landed through LiquidPhysics.AddLiquid in VERB-CONTRACT increments (1 ml a squeeze, 0.1 g a spatula dip, 0.5 ml tilt-pour ticks WITH human overshoot). Completion may only arrive through the real event chain: AddLiquid → LiquidAdded → binding → CompleteTask, rack-group polls, ZoneSimStation sims. The first version drove binding.HandleReagent directly and reported Exp 2 CLEAN while a real player was hard-stuck — the binding had never subscribed to its vessel's events, a bug th

### `SpatulaPorcelain` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SpatulaPorcelain.cs`</sub>

W5.12 (user): the manuscript specifies a PORCELAIN spatula, but our Spatula prefab shipped with the shared metal EquipmentMat and read as steel. This finds every Spatula prefab instance in the scene (by SOURCE prefab, so it catches hand-placed/renamed copies like "Eq_Spatula" that carry no LabItem), applies the pack's white PorcelainMat, renames + labels it "Porcelain Spatula", gives it the full interaction wiring, and fixes the source prefab. Via the Mishandling table it now clinks like ceramic instead of clattering like metal. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void Run()
```

### `SpawnHeightWiring` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SpawnHeightWiring.cs`</sub>

Wires the fixed per-scene eye height onto the open scene's XR rig (user 2026-07-11: menu room and lab need DIFFERENT fixed heights, not relative to the player's real height). Run once per scene (MainMenu + SampleScene). Idempotent. Tune the two constants below and re-run to adjust.

```csharp
const float EyeHeight
static void Wire()
```

### `SpawnVfxBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/SpawnVfxBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the cyan "materialize" spawn burst (user 2026-07-10): a one-shot column of cyan particles that rises from the player's feet like smoke, played on every teleport / reset / spawn. Creates a shared soft-dot texture + additive material, then drops a configured `SpawnVFX` object (SpawnBurstFX + ParticleSystem) into the ACTIVE scene. Re-runnable. Run it once in MainMenu and once in SampleScene. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Build Spawn VFX.

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `StoolTools` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/StoolTools.cs`</sub>

Edit-mode helper (user 2026-07-10: "let me select + reposition the stools in the editor, not in Play mode"). The stools sit tucked under the tables, so clicking them in a crowded Scene view is fiddly. This selects all of them in one go — then move them with the transform gizmo and run Re-Home Scene Items to make it stick. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Select Stools (edit mode).

```csharp
static void SelectStools()
```

### `TubeRackSlotBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TubeRackSlotBuilder.cs`</sub>

TOGETHER WITH their kit holders, so every copy arrived already seated correctly relative to its rack. A first pass here also shipped a "Seat Tubes In Slots" menu that would have MOVED all 19 perfectly-placed tubes onto bounds-GUESSED slots and destroyed that placement — it is deleted. Never re-derive rack positions the scene already has right. Only the workspace holders need anchors, because they are the only racks that start EMPTY (the player drags tubes in mid-experiment), so there is no seated tube to copy a position from. Workflow: 1. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Name Tubes + Build Rack Slots   (this) 2. Drag each green Slot_* gizmo until its ghost tube sits in the holder's hole 3. Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Re-Home Scene Items (Adopt Current)  (bakes homes — a broken tube respawns at its baked home via BreakableGlassware→DropRespawn)

### `TutorialModeBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/TutorialModeBuilder.cs`</sub>

Tutorial Mode scene wiring (2026-08-07). Mirrors DemoModeBuilder's shape so the two special modes are built the same way: • Build Tutorial Menu Button — MainMenu scene: clones the Laboratory button into a "Tutorial" button wired to MainMenuController.OnTutorialLaboratory. Unlike the Demo button this one is ALWAYS visible — practice mode is a shipped feature, not a config-gated demo affordance. Idempotent: re-running re-labels and re-wires the existing button in place.

```csharp
static void BuildMenuButton()
static void FixMenuLayout()
static void BuildRoomFx()
static void BuildSceneWiring()
```

### `VoiceAudioBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceAudioBuilder.cs`</sub>

Makes the generated voice-over actually AUDIBLE and well-behaved (2026-07-27). Three separate faults, one pass: 1. Dr. Jimenez was silent. His narration channel had NO narratorAudioSource, and SayRoutine only plays a clip when one exists — so every one of his 37 lines fell straight through to the placeholder blips. 2. Voices were fully 3D, so they faded to nothing a couple of metres away. The client wants them heard across the room but LOUDER up close, which is a partial spatial blend: the 2D share guarantees a floor everywhere, the 3D share still swells as you approach. 3. The music sat at full level under dialogue.

```csharp
const float VoiceSpatialBlend
const float VoiceMinDistance
const float VoiceMaxDistance
const float MusicDuckTo
static void Apply()
```

### `VoiceImportTool` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceImportTool.cs`</sub>

Imports the generated voice clips and wires the bank into the scene: 1. Quest-friendly import settings on Audio/Voice/** (mono, Vorbis). 2. Rebuilds VoiceBank.asset from Audio/Voice/<Speaker>/<id>.mp3|wav. 3. Points every NPCNarrationController in the open scene at the bank — controllers under Dr. Jimenez speak as Jimenez, everything else as Pharmee. Missing clips keep today's blip+typewriter. Idempotent.

```csharp
static void ImportAndWire()
```

### `VoiceManifestExporter` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceManifestExporter.cs`</sub>

Exports the full voice-over manifest (user 2026-07-10: NPCs speak): every code-authored line (VoiceCorpus) plus every cutscene beat, one row per unique (speaker, text) with its stable id. Tools/voice/generate-voice.ps1 consumes the manifest; changed lines re-key and regenerate individually.

### `ManifestLine` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoiceManifestExporter.cs`</sub>

### `VoicePolish` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VoicePolish.cs`</sub>

Pre-recording copy pass over the CUTSCENE beats (2026-07-27). Every beat is a SUBTITLE **and** a text-to-speech script, so a line can be perfectly good on screen and wrong in the ear — or, worse, describe apparatus that no longer exists. Run this before spending voice credits: changing a line changes its VoiceLineId, so the manifest must be re-exported afterwards anyway. Edits the assets through SerializedObject rather than the YAML, because these subtitles contain ": " (e.g. "Welcome back! Today: Acetone.") which a hand-written scalar silently truncates.

```csharp
static void Polish()
static void SyncGateLines()
static string ApplyRules(string subtitle)
static bool IsRecordingSafe(string line)
```

### `VrAffordanceBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VrAffordanceBuilder.cs`</sub>

Wires the 2026-07-10 VR affordance batch into the open scene: 1. HAPTICS — every hand interactor (NearFar + Poke) gets a HapticImpulsePlayer + SimpleHapticFeedback so grabbing, socket-snapping and poking UI buzz. 2. HOVER HIGHLIGHT — every grabbable gets a HoverHighlight so it brightens + pops when a hand/ray hovers it (small real-scale tools are easy to find). 3. SOCKET GHOST — every station socket shows a translucent preview of the correct item snapped in place. (Runtime-spawned experiment props/sockets get 2 & 3 from ExperimentSceneBuilder; haptics is interactor-side so it covers everything automatically.) Tools ▸ PharmaSynth ▸ Wire VR Affordances (edit mode, idempotent).

```csharp
static void Build()
```

### `VrUiFixes` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/VrUiFixes.cs`</sub>

Two VR-UI scene fixes (user 2026-07-15). • Quiz answers unclickable: a world-space Canvas needs a TrackedDeviceGraphicRaycaster for the XR ray to hit it — a plain GraphicRaycaster is mouse-only. The scene had 10 GraphicRaycasters but only 3 tracked ones, so most panels (incl. the quiz) ignored the controller ray. • Dr. Jimenez's subtitles floated at local y=2.15 — above head height, up by the ceiling and unreadable. Lowered to just above his head. Both idempotent.

```csharp
static void FixRaycasters()
static void FixDialogueHeight()
```

### `W533Fixes` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/W533Fixes.cs`</sub>

W5.33 playtest batch (user 2026-07-27) — the SCENE half of the fixes whose code half lives in the runtime scripts. One idempotent menu per symptom so a single broken area can be re-run alone; "Fix Everything" runs them in order. Why a new pass instead of re-running the old builders: three apparatus were dropped into the scene as RAW model prefabs that never went through any wiring (no collider, no rigidbody, no XRGrabInteractable — literally ungrabbable), the wash bottle was never given contents, and the balance was pure set dressing. None of the existing menus own those.

```csharp
static readonly string[] UngrabbableReport
static void FixEverything()
static readonly string[] FixedRacks
static void FixRacksAnchored()
static readonly string[] YieldWidgets
static void FixYieldGone()
static GameObject FindAnyByName(string n)

### `W58VerbDataApplier` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/W58VerbDataApplier.cs`</sub>

One-shot, idempotent data pass for the W5.8 verb overhaul: re-points the layouts whose tasks are now TOOL verbs (weigh/stir/grind) and wires the scene-side pieces (Methane's hand-built mortar, the matches-box striker). • Acetone: `weigh-acetates` zone-touch → Weigh (scoopula on the pan). • Benzamide: `stand` ("Stir & stand") zone-touch → Stir (glass rod). • Scene: Methane's Eq_Motar/Eq_Pestle get a GrindController completing `prepare-mixture` (dual-path with the legacy zone-touch), and the matches dispenser box becomes a MatchStrikerSurface. (The Aspirin + Caffeine passes were dropped 2026-07-16 with their modules.)

sulfuric acid; no alcohol anywhere) → propyl alcohol staged + bound, rule re-pointed to it (manuscript/test intent: ester with propyl). M2  Chloroform was missing the manuscript's oxidation confirmatory test (K-dichromate + conc H2SO4, procedure L3419-21 + results sheet) → new task + reagent + reaction rule. M3  Wine Making fermented GRAPE juice against the manuscript's explicit grape exclusion (L3830-31) → Chem_GrapeJuice renamed "Mixed Fruit Juice" (GUID refs untouched; string lookups updated). M4  Reagent fidelity: Acetanilide prep-HCl 6N→0.1N; iodoform tests gain their missing KI (Ethyl Alcohol + Acetone); ester/acid tests use the manuscript's DILUTED acids — with the matching RULE inputs re-pointed (rules match by asset; a layout-only swap would kill the reactions). M5a Chemical Compounding quiz Q3 asked about unsaturation (bromine) in an all-saturated module → replaced with the man

apparatus that belong together… place them tightly but not overlapping… generous duplicates of high-use glass"). Kit composition follows the manuscript's Appendix C Equipment lists + the game's Methane heating rig: TOP row   — Heating Set A (full Bunsen rig), Heating Set B (compact Bunsen rig), Alcohol-Burner Set (spirit lamp + clay triangle + crucible: the crucible-work set — the manuscript names no burner, so Bunsen = sustained heat, alcohol lamp = crucible). LOWER row — 4 test-tube rack kits (regular tubes / amber HARD-GLASS tubes / vials / empty drying rack) + brush & wash bottle, then the duplicate glassware and small tools. Existing loose apparatus under "EquipmentShelf" is ADOPTED into matching slots (moved + re-homed); anything missing spawns fresh from the SceneAssetLibrary under a "WorkspaceKits" root. Every placed item gets the full interaction treatment (PhysicsAudit.WireScen

### `WorkspaceLabelPurge` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/WorkspaceLabelPurge.cs`</sub>

Removes the stale Methane-tutorial text labels that float over the center workspace (user 2026-07-12: "delete the texts still floating around the main workspace"). They were authored directly under WorldLabels (NOT under MethaneStage), so toggling the Methane stage never hid them, and the table-merge left them orphaned at the old x≈1.15 position. Pure scene leftovers — no script references them. Landmark labels (PPE locker, fume hood) and runtime DynLabel_* are kept. Idempotent + re-runnable.

```csharp
static void Purge()
```

### `WorkspaceShelfBuilder` <sub>class</sub>
<sub>`Assets/PharmaSynth/Scripts/Editor/WorkspaceShelfBuilder.cs`</sub>

Builds the equipment-shelf platforms on the center-table overhead gantry. W5.10 built one row on the rail tops; W5.12 adds the SECOND, lower row the user hand-planked at y≈1.20 (four duplicated cabinet shelves — replaced here by clean full-width tiles + slim side posts so the lower row reads as built in, not floating). Idempotent + re-runnable. Geometry lives in the pure WorkspaceShelfMath; the apparatus kits go on via Build Workspace Kits.
