/// the enol test, three butyl alcohols beside a negative control, acetone beside
/// acetaldehyde, hydrolysed beside unhydrolysed aspirin. In every case **the
/// comparison across the tubes IS the lesson**, so the step is only done when
/// every tube that the step names has had its reagent.
///
/// This exists because LiquidTaskBinding is per-VESSEL: give five tubes a binding
/// for the same task and the first tube to hit its threshold completes it,
/// quietly making the other four optional and throwing the lesson away. The rack
/// members are authored completesTask:false (so their pours are expected and

    /// count is 19 and the required count is the number of roles the step names — five
