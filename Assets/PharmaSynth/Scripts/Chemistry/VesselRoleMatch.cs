/// Exp 2 authors five enol tubes, four alkaline-oxidation tubes and four acidic ones, and
/// each was pinned to a SPECIFIC bench tube. In VR the player grabs whichever tube is
/// nearest, so "pour the ethanol into tube 0" is guidance they cannot act on: pouring the
/// right reagent into the wrong-numbered tube was graded a wrong-reagent mistake even
/// though the chemistry was correct. A rack group's members are interchangeable glassware,
/// so the role should follow the pour, not the other way round.
///
/// ⛔ CLAIMING MUST BE DEFERRED, not decided on the first pour. The four alkaline tubes all
/// take KMnO₄ then NaOH and differ only at the THIRD reagent (n-butyl / sec-butyl /
/// tert-butyl). Claiming eagerly would assign a role arbitrarily on pour one and then
/// punish a perfectly correct third pour. So a tube holds a CANDIDATE SET that each pour
/// narrows; it is claimed only once one candidate survives, and a pour is wrong only when
/// the set empties. The enol group happens to disambiguate on pour one (five different
/// alcohols) — that falls out of the same rule rather than needing a special case.
///
/// Pure and keyed by strings so the whole rule set is suite-testable with no scene, no
/// ScriptableObjects and no rack.
