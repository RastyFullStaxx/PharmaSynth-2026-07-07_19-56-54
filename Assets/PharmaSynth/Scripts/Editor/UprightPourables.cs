/// Fits lab items to reality: stands tipped glassware up, puts an item's PIVOT and grab
/// collider back on its own mesh, seats it on the surface below, and re-bakes its respawn
/// home (W5.55 upright · W5.56 seat · W5.57 pivot).
///
/// ⛔ A vessel whose RESTING pose reads as tipped pours itself forever: `LiquidPourer.Update`
/// fires on `Vector3.Angle(Vector3.up, transform.up) > pourThreshold`, so it empties every
/// drop put into it and runs its looping pour audio under everything else. W5.45 found both
/// distilling flasks at 90 degrees; the suite has pinned it since, and it came back the
/// moment a `Re-Home Scene Items (Adopt Current)` pass ran while a flask happened to be
/// lying down — adoption bakes whatever pose it finds, tipped or not.
///
/// ⛔ An item whose visible mesh is not on its own PIVOT cannot be placed by anyone and is
/// held nowhere near the player's hand (W5.57). Four Tripo/USD imports carried their geometry
/// 0.7–1.9 m from their origin: both distilling flasks, the ice bucket and the matchstick.
/// Dragging the object in the Scene view moves the pivot; the mesh keeps its offset and hangs
/// in the air wherever it is put. Worse, the runtime reads `transform.position` —
/// `Matchstick` measures its strike distance from it, `VaporCollectController` its receiver
/// radius, `DropRespawn` its home — so a grabbed match was "held" 1.9 m from the hand and no
/// burner could be lit in VR. The simulators never noticed: they drive the APIs directly.
///
/// Straightening or re-pivoting the transform alone never sticks: `DropRespawn.ResetAllHome`
/// puts the baked pose back at the start of every run, so the HOME is rewritten too. Pinned
/// by the `pour:` and `grab:` suite lines. Idempotent: a bench that is already right is left
/// completely alone.
