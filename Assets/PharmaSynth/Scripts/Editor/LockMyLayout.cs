///   1. Tidy duplicate names  — "Beaker (1)" → "Beaker_100mL_2", + full
///      interaction wiring for any raw duplicate that was missing it.
///   2. Re-home every item     — current transform becomes its respawn home
///      (moved originals AND duplicates), so nothing snaps back in Play.
///   3. Save the scene.
/// Run this after ANY manual arrangement; then it's locked with no need to ping
/// Claude. Purely additive — spawns/destroys nothing.
