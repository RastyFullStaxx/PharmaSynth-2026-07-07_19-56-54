/// Builds the lab's REFLECTION and LIGHT probes (user 2026-08-28, "aesthetic lab").
///
/// The scene had ZERO of both, while the Mobile RP asset already had reflection-probe
/// blending AND box projection switched on - the features were paid for with nothing to feed
/// them. Two consequences the player sees constantly:
///
///   * Every glass material in the ChemLab pack sets _EnvironmentReflections = 1, so with no
///     probe they all sampled the DEFAULT reflection - the built-in procedural outdoor sky -
///     inside a sealed windowless room. That is why beakers and flasks read as pale plastic.
///   * Every dynamic object (all grabbable glassware, held items, Pharmee, Dr. Jimenez) was
///     lit by flat ambient alone, so a beaker was lit identically under a closed cabinet and
///     directly beneath a lamp. Nothing in the room grounded anything.
///
/// Probe placement is DERIVED from the room's own renderer bounds rather than hard-coded, so
/// it survives the furniture moves the user makes through Select Movable Furniture.
///
/// Tools > PharmaSynth > Build Lab Probes (edit mode, idempotent - deletes and rebuilds its
/// own root). Run the lighting bake afterwards to populate them.
