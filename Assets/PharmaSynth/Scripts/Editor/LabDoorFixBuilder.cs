/// Makes the lab door actually open, and actually stop you before it does (W5.55, user in
/// the headset: "fix the door opening. it is not doing that open function. Im just walking
/// through it now").
///
/// ⛔ THE DOOR WAS NEVER BROKEN IN CODE. `DoorOpener` was wired correctly — its `door` field
/// resolves to the leaf, `PharmeeGatekeeper.doorOpener` is assigned, and `SetOpen(true)`
/// fires on DoorArmed. Two SCENE faults hid all of that:
///
///   1. The leaf inherits the Environment prefab's `m_StaticEditorFlags = 87`, which
///      includes **Batching Static**. A static-batched renderer is merged into a combined
///      mesh at load and then IGNORES its transform, so the leaf's collider swung open
///      while the drawn door stayed shut. The player walks through what looks like a closed
///      door, and no amount of reading DoorOpener explains it. Contribute GI goes with it:
///      a door that moves must not carry a lightmap baked in the closed position.
///   2. `doorBlocker` was null, so nothing held the player back while the gate was still
///      talking. The blocker is a plain trigger-free box across the doorway that the
///      gatekeeper enables and disables; it is created here so the scene stops depending on
///      someone having hand-placed one.
///
/// Idempotent: re-running finds the same objects and rewrites the same values.
/// ⚠ The leaf was lightmap- and navmesh-static, so after running this go through
/// `Build Lab Probes` → `Run Lab Lighting Bake` → `Build Lab NavMesh`.
