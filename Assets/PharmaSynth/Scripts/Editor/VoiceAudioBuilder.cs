///  1. Dr. Jimenez was silent. His narration channel had NO narratorAudioSource,
///     and SayRoutine only plays a clip when one exists — so every one of his 37
///     lines fell straight through to the placeholder blips.
///  2. Voices were fully 3D, so they faded to nothing a couple of metres away.
///     The client wants them heard across the room but LOUDER up close, which is
///     a partial spatial blend: the 2D share guarantees a floor everywhere, the
///     3D share still swells as you approach.
///  3. The music sat at full level under dialogue.
