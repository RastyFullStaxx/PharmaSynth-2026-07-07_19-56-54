/// (y 0.91, x −1.85…1.40, z −3.94…−2.74; the player works the +z front edge)
/// is divided into four zones; every layout's items are re-seated onto the
/// deterministic slots below, in authored order:
///   • STATIONS  — ONE back row, 0.5 m pitch (verbs need elbow room; the
///     busiest module has 7 stations — exactly one full row)
///   • VESSELS   — center-front, where both hands can reach
///   • REAGENTS  — right-side grid (pourable bottles), 4 per column
///   • TOOLS     — left-side grid (rods, tongs, dishes…), 3 per column
/// The front strip z > −2.90 stays free for the builder's rack, spares and
/// match kits. Suite-pinned; the LayoutTidy menu writes these into the SOs.
