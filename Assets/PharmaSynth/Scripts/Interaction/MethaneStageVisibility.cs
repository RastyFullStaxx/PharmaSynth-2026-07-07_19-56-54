/// W5.12 (user 2026-07-13): the hand-built Methane stage should be PRESENT only
/// during the Lab Tour and the Methane tutorial itself, and gone the moment you
/// move on to any other experiment or are idle in the lab. Methane is the only
/// experiment that uses this stage (Experiment 1), so a single controller owns
/// its visibility — the sole authority (ExperimentSceneBuilder no longer toggles
/// it). Lives on a manager object, NOT on the stage (it must keep running while
/// the stage is hidden). Edit mode leaves the stage as-authored so it can be
/// relocated by hand; this only governs Play.
///
/// The user hand-moved the 5 methane PROPS out of the stage hierarchy onto the
/// workspace, so toggling the stage alone would leave them visible ("leaking").
/// This also gathers those loose props by their methane itemIds and toggles them
/// alongside the stage — no reparenting, so the hand placement is untouched.
