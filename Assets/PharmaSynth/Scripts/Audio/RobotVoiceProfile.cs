/// ONE shared tuning for Pharmee's robot voice (user 2026-07-27: "make it one
/// reusable effect so once we tune it, it applies to other voices of Pharmee").
///
/// Every RobotVoiceFx reads this asset, so there is a single place to dial the
/// character and it reaches every line she will ever speak — generated or not.
/// Tuning never costs a credit and never requires regenerating audio.
///
/// It is a ScriptableObject on purpose: values changed while PLAY is running are
/// written to the asset and SURVIVE exiting play mode, unlike edits to a scene
/// component. So you can tune by ear in a live session and keep what you land on.
///
/// ⭐ THE CHOSEN CHARACTER (user 2026-07-28, after hearing all the alternatives):
/// RING MODULATION at a LOW carrier, blended with dry signal. The user describes
/// it as "speaking against an electric fan" and WANTS that — just not too strong.
/// This was arrived at by elimination, so do not "improve" it away:
///   • Heavier band-limiting  -> "muffled"           (rejected)
///   • Decimation + comb      -> "sounds so human"   (rejected — it recolours
///                                timbre but leaves the human pitch contour)
///   • Full VOCODER           -> "so much worse"     (rejected outright, even
///                                though it is the textbook robot technique)
/// The vocoder, decimation and comb code all still exist and are simply switched
/// off here. Turning them back on is a values change, not a code change — but ask
/// first, because every one of them has already been auditioned and refused.
