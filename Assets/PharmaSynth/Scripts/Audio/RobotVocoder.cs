/// A channel vocoder — the technique behind essentially every convincing robot
/// voice (user 2026-07-28: "it's now clear, but sounds so human").
///
/// WHY FILTERING PLATEAUED. Decimation, comb resonance and bit-crush change a
/// voice's TIMBRE, but they leave its excitation intact: the pitch contour, the
/// vibrato, the breath, the micro-timing of real vocal cords. Those are what the
/// ear uses to decide "human", so no amount of colouring gets past "a woman,
/// processed".
///
/// A vocoder attacks the source instead. It splits the voice into N frequency
/// bands and measures only the ENERGY ENVELOPE of each — that envelope is what
/// carries the words, and it contains no pitch information at all. Those
/// envelopes are then imposed on a SYNTHETIC carrier at a fixed pitch. The
/// consonants and vowels survive; the vocal cords are thrown away and replaced
/// by an oscillator. That is the difference between "human with an effect" and
/// "a machine talking".
///
/// Keeping her FEMALE: the carrier pitch is the voice's new pitch, so a carrier
/// in the 180-260 Hz range reads female while staying perfectly monotone — and
/// monotone is a large part of what reads as robotic.
///
/// Unvoiced sounds (s, f, sh, t) contain no pitch, so a pure tonal carrier turns
/// them to mush. The carrier therefore blends in noise, which is what restores
/// intelligibility on sibilants.
