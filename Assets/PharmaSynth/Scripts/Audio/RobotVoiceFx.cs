/// Pharmee is a FEMALE ROBOT. Text-to-speech gives a natural human read, so the
/// machine character is applied as a FILTER on her voice channel — never baked
/// into the 182 clips, so retuning stays free.
///
/// ⭐ THE CHOSEN CHARACTER is LOW-FREQUENCY RING MODULATION blended with dry
/// signal — what the user calls "speaking against an electric fan" and settled on
/// after auditioning everything else (2026-07-28). `ringMix` is the fan's strength.
///
/// This file also contains a vocoder, sample-and-hold decimation and a comb
/// resonator, all currently SWITCHED OFF in the profile. They are kept because
/// each was built to answer a real complaint, and the history is worth preserving
/// so nobody re-derives it:
///   • Heavy band-limiting -> "muffled". Fixed by opening the low-pass to 11 kHz
///     and adding the presence lift; those two ARE still in use.
///   • Decimation + comb   -> technically more machine-like, but the verdict was
///     "sounds so human" — they recolour timbre without touching pitch contour.
///   • Vocoder             -> the textbook robot technique (rebuilds the words on
///     a synthetic monotone carrier, discarding the vocal cords entirely) and the
///     verdict was "so much worse".
/// So: the strongest-on-paper techniques lost to the simplest one. Do not swap the
/// character back without asking — every alternative here has already been heard
/// and rejected.
///
/// Everything stays blended enough to keep the words legible: this is a teaching
/// game and Pharmee explains procedure.
