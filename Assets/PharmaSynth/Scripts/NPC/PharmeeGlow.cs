/// TWO separate causes, measured rather than guessed:
///   1. The robot FBX ships one emissive material, `Blue_Light`, at HDR (0.46, 2.75, 8.0) —
///      eight times white — on the body panel and all four hover rings. Dimmed here.
///   2. Her `White_Glossy` shell has NO emission at all and still blooms, because albedo
///      0.91 under the nearby fill light pushes the lit result past the 1.0 bloom threshold.
///      Dimming the emissive alone therefore could not have fixed it.
///
/// Everything is written through a MaterialPropertyBlock, the same pattern `PharmeeFace`
/// uses: no material is instanced, the FBX and its importer stay untouched, and both values
/// are tunable live in the inspector. Thin over pure `PharmeeGlowMath`; `Bind*` seams exist
/// because AddComponent fires no Awake in edit mode.
